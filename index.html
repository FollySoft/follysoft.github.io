                            My name is Jonathan West,  I typically go by "jwest" in online spaces. I'm a hobbyist game designer, photographer, and on rare ocassion a writer, based in southern New Mexico.  
                            I'm a proud dad of three, and work full time as a R&D Software Developer.  You'll frequently find me wearing a flannel shirt and talking about my favorite math rock bands.

                            This website at one point served entirely as a portfolio of my game and UX design experience, as a sort of showcase for potential employers.  
                            However, as I'm no longer job hunting, I thought I could take the opportunity to try to make this space a little bit more my own.  Right now,
                            it is basically serving as a portfolio, but I hope to let it grow natrually and organically to serve more creative explorations in 
                            the web-space.  I'm trying my best to build this space up from scratch ♥

                            You'll often find me using photos from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank"><b>Wikimedia Commons</b></a>, <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank"><b>Pexels</b></a>, 
                            or <a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="_blank"><b>Pixabay</b></a> in my games and other projects, however each photo background found on this site is from my own camera.
                            Most are available on my <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@jonathan-west-339535484/" target="_blank"><b>personal Pexels page</b></a>, where they can be freely downloaded for anyone else's own creative pursuits.

                            I'm inspired by things that are playful, things that subvert your expectations and get you to crack a smile at the results.  
                            We live in an age that treats technology as both a luxury and a necessity, as priceless tools that work for us rather than play along 
                            with us.  To me, the best creative works are the ones that show us otherwise.
    
                            Some of my favorite pieces of playful technology and digital games include:

                            It was designed to play off of the element of surprise, while also reminding the user how easily accessible data can sometimes become if we aren't
                            careful.  All image templates were taken from Pexels and Wikimedia Commons and edited in GIMP, while the screensaver itself was made with GameMaker.

                            While the overall game mechanics are simple, I tried to lean into the silliness of using your controller in such an unorthodox manner in what was meant to be a professional setting.  
                            The games aesthetics were intended to match that of bland corporate software.

                            giving them as much free-reign as they wanted to establish the characters as they saw fit.  The result ended up being far better and added more character to the game than I ever could have accomplished on my own.  Their credits can be found on

                            Gradience is a stack of photos of sunsets I have taken from my home in New Mexico.  Minimizing the amount of objects in the sky, I tried my best to capture
                            nothing but the natural color gradients that appear in the sky at dusk.  This webpage then simply stacks the photos on top of one another, and slowly
                            fades between each one in a sort of looping slideshow.

                            This is the first project that I attempted to do all of the artwork with public domain images, found primarily on wikimedia commons.  While much of the audio was
                            taken from FreeSound, I recorded a handful of sound effects myself, in my car on lunch breaks.  Twisting water bottles to make crunching sounds and pitching up my own
                            voice saying "ouch" to fill out the cocophony of sound effects was a real treat.

                            as well as survival time and total roaches killed. The game was paced in an effort to encourage players to "punch" their keyboard, hitting multiple keys at a time, but still playable
                            for people who might have issues with rollover or ghosting issues with their keyboards.

                            A manifesto written for the 2022 Manifesto Jam.  I created it with the help of a close friend, Mackenzie Ito, as an exploration into my own creative motivations and practices, and what it means to be "foolish" in your work.
                        </p>                      
                        <p>
                           The writing came as a result of years of dipping into a variety of readings and studies based around the broader concepts of "play", in both practical and spiritual perspectives.  
                           In reflecting on my work, and trying to understand the reasons for the decisions I made in designing and developing a game, I found that many of my motivations (or even lackthereof) closely resembled that of a fool,
                           both in a historical and more modern context.  In many ways, I still feel as though the manifesto only scratched the surface of my thoughts on this, but it was definitely helpful
                           in connecting some of those dots in my head.

                            A wordle clone with acolorful twist, made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/hexes-eggplant-podcast-community-game-jam-12" target="_blank">12th Eggplant Podcast Community Game Jam</a>.  Players are given 6 chances to guess a randomized color of the page's background.  However,
                            their guesses must be in hexadecimal format.

                        <p>
                            This game originally started as <a href="https://twitter.com/jrcwest/status/1489610464203997188" target="_blank">a joke response to a tweet</a>, suggesting that every game designer "is to be legally obliged to make a wordle variant."  While my response was intended
                            as a joke, the idea stuck in my head, and the theme for the current Eggplant Podcast game jam happened to be "fun with hexes."  I looked for a tutorial to help me get started with the basic
                            ground work of a "wordle-clone" and built the game up from there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I experimented with a variety of pre-built CSS animations to see how best to convey information to the player based on their guesses.  By coloring each full guess, players would get some
                            assistance in determining which portion of their guess was too high or too low.  In an effort to create a more "sharable solution", like the emoji-based ones used in the original wordle, I attempted to
                            create an image that provided a color gradient of the player's guesses, using an html canvas.  However, I could not figure out a way to take the image and make it easily transferrable to a player's clipboard.                       
                        </p>
                        <div class="content-images">

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            One area of design that needed improvement, however, was indicating to players if there were any duplicate hexadecimal characters within the solution.  I unfortunately ran out of time before the 
                            end of the jam to find a good solution to the problem, but feedback from players offered some helpful suggestions that I would like to explore in the future.

                        <p>
                            The game was originally designed to be competitive in nature, with players wrestling for control over the mouse, as a submission to the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mouse-jam/rate/1129899" taerget="_blank">8 Bits to Infinity Mouse Jam</a> over the course of one week.
                            I spent the majority of the jam attempting to pull the game together, using assets created by friends (Rhaphiel Molinar for art, Symochi for music). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, I did not spend any time until almost the end
                            of the jam playtesting, and the original design simply did not work.  Given the quality of music and art that was provided to me, I felt the need to make another attempt at making the game more enjoyable overall.
                            I opted to redesign the game to be cooperative, and added obstacles that players would need to work together to avoid.

                            This game was my first real introduction into the world of alt-ctrl games, being heavily inspired by <a href="https://jwhop.itch.io/yolks-on-you" target="_blank">Yolk's on You</a> by Jonny Hopkins.  While Shuriken is a simple idea at it's core,
                            this simplicity allowed me to explore the pixellated aesthetics of the game.  There is also a lot of room to expand on content, should I decide to revisit the game in the future.

                            Dynamo's core functionality is simple - It's light is powered by touch.  Pressing the button will charge your dynamo, but the charge only lasts for ~1 second.  
                            With this core mechanic, we designed 3 different games with very flexible rules, and encouraged players to "think playfully" and create their own games and modify the ones we provided.

                            Dynamo was originally inspired by the game <a href="http://www.foddy.net/2010/10/chicanery/" target="_blank">Chicanery</a>, originally designed by Anna Anthropy.  During the course of playtesting the original game, however, testers
                            naturally sought out new ways to play with the core mechanic.  The developers at Move38 and I decided to lean into this, and ship a product that was 3-games in one, with a rule book than encouraged breaking the rules and creating
                            games of their own.

                            A physical action game for Blinks with 2 or more players.  Players choose between 3 weapons and fight to the death, attempting to line up their "lit" LED's with their opponents unlit ones to cause damage.

                            The game was loosely based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_tapping" target="_blank">Egg Jarping</a>.  I had a lot of fun experimenting with different weapon styles, limited to the 6-LED display on a single Blink tile.
                            Each weapon is intended to fit different difficulties - if players wanted to give themselves or other players a "handicap", they could use a weapon with more LEDs, offering them more protection as well as additonal places to cause damage.

                            A silly alt-ctrl game, made (though not submitted) for a game jam hosted by Coolmath Games, where the theme was "use your head."  Players use their nose to type the words that appear on the screen, being scored by
                            their accuracy as well as the number of words completed within the time limit.

                            A 2-player mode, titled "Head-To-Head", was also made for the game, whereby players would have to share a single keyboard and compete to type out words that only contained letters on their half of the keyboard.
                            In order to help create a smoother user experience, the words were also spoken to the players through their computer speakers, recorded by my friend Alex Pait.  However, the mode was completed not long into the 
                            height of the COVID-19 pandemic.  As such, due to the nature of the intimacy of players keeping their faces so close together and on a shared keyboard, the mode was never really released in public builds.

                            California State University, Long Beach, for PC and Mobile Platforms. I contributed to the project as a designer.  The player is tasked with fashioning a “wheel” from a misshapen boulder within a small window of time.  
                            Once the time is up, their “wheel” is rolled down a hill, it’s final resting point representing the player’s score.

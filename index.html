                            My name is Jonathan West,  I typically go by "jwest" in online spaces. I'm a hobbyist game designer, photographer, and on rare ocassion a writer, based in southern New Mexico.  
                            I'm a proud dad of three, and work full time as a R&D Software Developer.  You'll frequently find me wearing a flannel shirt and talking about my favorite math rock bands.

                            This website at one point served entirely as a portfolio of my game and UX design experience, as a sort of showcase for potential employers.  
                            However, as I'm no longer job hunting, I thought I could take the opportunity to try to make this space a little bit more my own.  Right now,
                            it is still somewhat serving as a portfolio, but I hope to let it grow natrually and organically to serve more creative explorations in 
                            the web-space.  I'm trying my best to code this space from scratch ♥

                            You'll often find me using photos from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank"><b>Wikimedia Commons</b></a>, <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank"><b>Pexels</b></a>, 
                            or <a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="_blank"><b>Pixabay</b></a> in my games and other projects, however each photo background found on this site is from my own camera.
                            Most are available on my <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@jonathan-west-339535484/" target="_blank"><b>personal Pexels page</b></a>, where they can be freely downloaded for anyone else's own creative pursuits.

                            The icons found in here, however, are taken from <a href="https://boxicons.com/" target="_blank"><b>boxicons.com</b></a>.  The font used in my logo, up there in the top right of the page,
                            is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue"><b>Bebas Neue</b></a>.  I just really like that font a lot.

                            I'm inspired by things that are playful, things that subvert your expectations and get you to crack a smile at the results.  
                            We live in an age that treats technology as both a luxury and a necessity, as priceless tools that work for us rather than play along 
                            with us.  To me, the best creative works are the ones that show us otherwise.
    
                            Some of my favorite pieces of playful technology and digital games include:

                            It was designed to play off of the element of surprise, while also reminding the user how easily accessible data can sometimes become if we aren't
                            careful.  All image templates were made in GIMP, while the screensaver itself was made with GameMaker.

                            While the overall game mechanics are simple, I tried to lean into the silliness of using your controller in such an unorthodox manner in what was meant to be a professional setting.  
                            The games aesthetics were intended to match that of bland corporate software.

                            nothing but the natural color gradients that appear in the sky at dusk.  This webpage then simply stacks the photos on top of one another, and slowly
                            fades between each one in a sort of looping slideshow.

                        <p>
                            This is the first project that I attempted to do all of the artwork with public domain images, found primarily on wikimedia commons.  While much of the audio was
                            taken from FreeSound, I recorded a handful of sound effects myself, in mar car on lunch breaks.  Twisting water bottles to make crunching sounds and pitching up my own
                            voice saying "ouch" to fill out the cocophony of sound effects was a real treat.                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Design-wise, the game's difficulty curve is fairly simplistic - the more time you spend in a round, the shorter the time roaches will spend on the keyboard before flying off.
                            There are also some roaches that will appear under the keys, using a wrench to try and pry off a key, rendering it unusable for the round.  Scores are based on key-pressing accuracy
                            as well as survival time and total roaches killed. The game was paced in an effort to encourage players to "punch" their keyboard, hitting multiple keys at a time, but still playable
                            for people who might have issues with rollover or ghosting issues with their keyboards.

                            A manifesto written for the 2022 Manifesto Jam.  I created it with the help of a close friend, Mackenzie Ito, as an exploration into my own creative motivations and practices.

                        <p>
                           The writing came as a result of years of dipping into a variety of readings and studies based around the broader concepts of "play", in both a practical perspectivr but also notablly in a sipratual one.  
                           In reflecting on my work, and trying to understand the reasons for the decisions I made in designing and developing a game, I found that many of my motivations (or even lackthereof) closely resembled that of a fool,
                           both in a historical and more modern context.  In many ways, I still feel as though the manifesto only scratched the surface of my thoughts on this, but it was definitely helpful
                           in connecting some of the dots in my own head.

                            their guesses must be in hexadecimal format.

                            This game originally started as <a href="https://twitter.com/jrcwest/status/1489610464203997188" target="_blank">a joke response to a tweet</a>, suggesting that every game designer "is to be legally obliged to make a wordle variant."  While my response was intended
                            as a joke, the idea stuck in my head, and the theme for the current Eggplant Podcast game jam happened to be "fun with hexes."  I looked for a tutorial to help me get started with the basic
                            ground work of a "wordle-clone" and built the game up from there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I experimented with a variety of pre-build CSS animations to see how best to convey information to the player based on their guesses.  By coloring each full guess, players would get some
                            assistance in determining which portion of their guess was too high or too low.  In an effort to create a more "sharable solution", like the emoji-based ones used in the original wordle, I attempted to
                            create an image that provided a color gradient of the player's guesses, using an html canvas.  However, I could not figure out a way to take the image and make it easily transferrable to a player's clipboard.                       
                        </p>
                        <div class="content-images">

                        <p>
                            One area of design that needed improvement, however, was indicating to players if there were any duplicate hexadecimal characters within the solution.  I unfortunately ran out of time before the 
                            end of the jam to find a good solution to the problem, but feedback from players offered some helpful suggestions that I would lke to explore in the future.

                        <p>
                            The game was originally designed to be competitive in nature, with players wrestling for control over the mouse, as a submission to the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mouse-jam/rate/1129899" taerget="_blank">8 Bits to Infinity Mouse Jam</a> over the course of one week.
                            I spent the majority of the jam attempting to pull the game together, using assets created by friends (Rhaphiel Molinar for art, Symochi for music). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, I did not spend any time until almost the end
                            of the jam playtesting, and the original design simply did not work.  Given the quality of music and art that was provided to me, I felt the need to make another attempt at making the game more enjoyable overall.
                            I opted to redesign the game to be cooperative, and added obstacles that players would need to work together to avoid.

    A Study of Spaces: Yooka-Laylee</span></h2>
    <br />

    tells me that at the time of writing this post, I have ~30 hours put 
    into Yooka-Laylee. &nbsp;I thoroughly enjoyed the game, and I still look to 
    complete it by collecting all of the collectibles. &nbsp;Playtonic did a 
    fantastic job bringing their original formula into the modern day, with 
    updated graphics and animations and large, sprawling worlds for the 
    player to explore.<br />
    <br />
    However, there seems to be a similar
    complaint among those who are faithful to the genre - after the first 
    world, there seems to be less of a desire to hunt down each and every 
    item or challenge. &nbsp;Many seem to feel that the levels become 
    "disconnected", and progression becomes very drawn out.&nbsp; I too have felt
    that this game has had a few flaws, and I want to explore exactly what 
    those are and what could have been done to fix them.&nbsp; The question this 
    puts in my head is this - How do you create a game in this genre, with 
    the aim to create the same feel as it's predecessors, while at the same 
    time meeting the trend of growing the space in which your game takes 
    place?<br />
    <br />
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">
    Why write this?</h2>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    Yooka-Laylee, and other games that fall under the <a href="http://jrcwest.blogspot.com/2017/04/free-range-platforming.html" target="_blank">Free-Range Platforming</a> genre, appeal to gamers who like to <i>explore, discover, </i>and<i> interact</i>
    within an interesting 3D space.&nbsp; While the game mechanics are important
    to the impression the player has over their experience, creating a 
    space that places the player in a state of flow is&nbsp;just as important, if not more-so.&nbsp; Everything down to the tactile interaction the player has 
    with the objects placed around them assists in creating a memorable and 
    enjoyable experience. &nbsp;It is in the expansion of these virtual spaces 
    that we often see a change between generations of gaming, as an increase
    in memory and processing power allows for bigger and more interactive 
    worlds to explore. &nbsp;To create a world that in non-linear, but also 
    naturally guides and encourages the player to take specific actions is a
    challenge indeed, and I hope to get a firm grasp on how 3D level design
    should be done for my own work in the future.</div>

    Despite how critical I may sound in the following paragraphs, I have 
    thoroughly enjoyed this game and cannot wait to see what Playtonic does 
    next.&nbsp; <i>I am by no means an expert on game design</i>, but I'd like to
    take a step closer to understanding why a game leaves a particular 
    impression on me.&nbsp; This blog post is simply a practice of taking what I 
    have learned from others and applying it to what I have experienced.&nbsp;

    <h2>
    <span style="font-size: small;">Overworld and Interest Curves</span></h2>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-size: small;">In
    his book, The Art of Game Design, Jesse Schell describes the methods in
    which developers organize the space in which their games take place.&nbsp; 
    The pattern in which these spaces are organized dictates the flow and 
    direction that the player will travel when progressing through the 
    game.&nbsp; Free-Range platformers of the 90's took the approach of arranging
    their levels and stages into a web, like so:</span></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br /></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ldRZXsttkc0/WRyutAdxdOI/AAAAAAAABv0/Mkbf3XFnkOEGOt8uCmpzDSFZJOdHrcAaQCLcB/s1600/Capture.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="488" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ldRZXsttkc0/WRyutAdxdOI/AAAAAAAABv0/Mkbf3XFnkOEGOt8uCmpzDSFZJOdHrcAaQCLcB/s640/Capture.PNG" width="640" /></a></div>
    <br /></div>
    <br /></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;Each
    of the yellow circles in the web above would represent a level of the 
    hub world (the floors of Grunty's Castle), while the branching purple 
    circles represent the smaller stages. &nbsp;The lines separating each of 
    these areas represent some kind of level transition or another (i.e. 
    doors or book portals). &nbsp;This is a quick sketch of my understanding of 
    the map, so if there are any shortcuts I missed, I'll edit the chart and
    add them in.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br />
    This
    segmented approach to level design marks an interesting transition 
    between the linear level progression that platformers have seen up to 
    this point, and the interconnected, open-world design that is often 
    favored among many adventure games today.&nbsp; This branching hub layout, 
    however, aids in creating an alternating interest curve for the player. 
    &nbsp;After the exhilaration of exploring a brand new world, returning to the
    hub grant the player a bit of down time before striking out on their 
    next big adventure.<br />
    <br />
    Yooka-Laylee's hub world is Hivory 
    Towers, the corporate lair of Capital B. &nbsp;The size of the hub world 
    matches that of one stage, each area carrying it's own unique challenges
    and characteristics. &nbsp;As opposed to several stages that branch from 
    this hub, however, Playtonic opted to create 5 <i>expandable</i> worlds,
    giving the player the freedom of choice to either try to progress 
    further into the overworld, or stick around and complete the level they 
    are currently playing. &nbsp;When this option is presented, it presents a 
    striking peak to the interest curve: &nbsp;either way, you are going to have 
    something brand new to experience, it's just a matter of deciding where 
    to go and what you spend your pagies on. <br />

    <i><span style="font-size: x-small;">*Attempted &nbsp;representation of my personal first play-through experience.</span></i></div>
    <br /></div>
    <br />
    Hivory
    Towers, on it's own, serves as the valleys to the interest peaks.&nbsp; Even
    though it is considered as the hub and overworld of the game, it is 
    usually treated as more of a sub-space in comparison to the other 
    stages.&nbsp; There is often less to collect, challenges for pagies are few 
    and far-between, and it is really just a pathway between levels.&nbsp; Having
    this familiarity in space in-between worlds that might be largely 
    unexplored, however, offers an important break from the excitement.&nbsp; 
    When Schell discusses his experience as a juggler in the past, he 
    describes these breaks as a chance for the audience "to relax and get to
    know you".&nbsp; Giving the player time to become absorbed into this world 
    could be considered an investment, as they will experience much more 
    excitement for the finale.<br />
    <br />
    This kind of interest curve can even be applied on a smaller scale, within each playable world.<span style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;">&nbsp;
    Part of what made the collect-athon so popular among it's followers was
    the addictive quality of consistently being rewarded for gathering 
    items.&nbsp; This creates a particular kind of arc in player interest - as 
    they explore a new world, they are picking up these items along the way,
    until they have come full circle and realize that they missed a few 
    notes somewhere along the way.&nbsp; Below is a reflection of my own interest
    curve when I played through Tribalstack Tropics:</span> </span></span><br />

    Context</h2>
    <div>
    It may be fate that around the time I started doing my research into 3D Platformers, I finally got around to opening up Swink's <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Feel-Designers-Sensation-Kaufmann/dp/0123743281/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493304052&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=game+feel" target="_blank">Game Feel</a></i>.
    &nbsp;Glossing over the table of contents made me jump ahead to his 
    masterful analysis on Super Mario 64, which was a mistake, as I 
    completely passed over his descriptions of the metrics he uses to 
    compare the "feel" of games. &nbsp;His discussion on the metric of "Context" 
    is one that felt the most relevant to the previously mentioned 
    criticisms of Y-L.<br />
    <u><br /></u>
    <u>The word context itself</u>&nbsp;is defined as "the circumstances that 
    form a setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which 
    it can be fully understood and assessed" (via google). &nbsp;In this regard, 
    Swink observes context in games as the interaction between physical 
    objects and their placement within a space. &nbsp;This includes most 
    attributes that are applied to the avatar, including size, speed, and 
    behavior.<br />
    <br />
    Swink uses 3 levels of context to measure the
    impression that the space leaves on the player: &nbsp;"High-Level Context", 
    which refers to the impressions of space, speed/motion, and size, 
    "Medium-Level Context", which observes immediate space and object 
    avoidance, and "Low-Level Context", which observes the tactile 
    interactions between object within personal space. &nbsp;Each of these 
    impressions can make or break the design of a level, especially within a
    3D space.<br />
    <br />
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">
    High-Level Context</h3>
    <br />
    The impression of space within any 
    level in this genre is one that evolves over time, as you begin to get a
    better understanding of your position by memorizing particular 
    landmarks. &nbsp;This is made even easier by the circular shape of each map, 
    that typically has a structure or large geographical feature at it's 
    center - a strong, centered landmark. &nbsp;This sort of design allows the 
    player to map the area as they explore without spelling out directions 
    for them. &nbsp;Anyone who has attended a good-sized carnival can relate to 
    this usage of landmarks - "Where was the cotton candy stand? &nbsp;Over by 
    that Ferris Wheel, right?".<br />
    <br />
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-og4zhC_KOeo/WQIZoZ2XMLI/AAAAAAAABrY/_v4vAqJqtlAV53f3pZlFGT5gto3atlJogCEw/s1600/Capture.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="396" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-og4zhC_KOeo/WQIZoZ2XMLI/AAAAAAAABrY/_v4vAqJqtlAV53f3pZlFGT5gto3atlJogCEw/s640/Capture.PNG" width="640" /></a></div>

    <i><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tribalstack Tropics, fully expanded.</span></i></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <br /></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    The first world that opens up to the player is <b>Tribalstack Tropics</b>,
    and it's layout demonstrates how the designer can guide this evolution 
    quite well. &nbsp;The screenshot below is one of the earliest views that the 
    player has after they spawn into this new and colorful environment. &nbsp;</div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br /></div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jjZjssrW2fg/WQIZoVkYCTI/AAAAAAAABrY/ZU-TLNM7vi8IlI3YSbnAapWQYDApRYNawCEw/s1600/general_impression.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="248" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jjZjssrW2fg/WQIZoVkYCTI/AAAAAAAABrY/ZU-TLNM7vi8IlI3YSbnAapWQYDApRYNawCEw/s400/general_impression.PNG" width="400" /></a></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br /></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br /></div>
    After
    following a short path from the spawn point, you are immediately met 
    with a fork in the road and a highly characteristic horizon. &nbsp;Directly 
    ahead of you is a temple that marks the center of the map, to your left 
    is a plain old dirt path, and to your right is a wooden bridge. &nbsp;If your
    eye is a little more keen, you might be taking a particular interest in
    the giant, neon pink arcade cabinet that also has a spot in your line 
    of sight... &nbsp;This early on, you would already be taking mental note of 
    this vantage point, giving you some notion of where to travel next if 
    you happen to find yourself at these crossroads again. &nbsp;There is no 
    mini-map or objective marker provided in the free-range platformer; the 
    player has to rely on their understanding of the world's layout based 
    upon the placement of these landmarks.<br />
    <i><br /></i>
    <br />
    <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <i>Landmarks are what players remember and what they talk about, for they are what make a space memorable.</i> </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    - Jesse Schell</blockquote>
    <br />
    This
    is not a new idea, and it doesn't need to be. &nbsp;Swink's breakdown of 
    Mario discusses Nintendo's use of context in their level design in great
    detail.&nbsp; His analysis on the High-Level Context application in Super 
    Mario 64 compares each stage's layout to "the zones of a theme park" 
    where the "landmark-focused approach" provides a "delightful sense of 
    vastness and exploration".&nbsp; As I previously mentioned, Banjo-Kazooie 
    also took this approach...<br />
    <br />
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NT_w3B0BvRE/WO6i3X4LLaI/AAAAAAAABnA/f-r7i7SRAvcy9vO1R248MwGFRPBR3mSxACPcB/s1600/mm_map.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="157" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NT_w3B0BvRE/WO6i3X4LLaI/AAAAAAAABnA/f-r7i7SRAvcy9vO1R248MwGFRPBR3mSxACPcB/s200/mm_map.PNG" width="200" /></a><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OiNtxiqC4bw/WO7BxHe4NfI/AAAAAAAABnc/A09ANKGscKgG-PJ-NmVXlLJb98QXGQVegCPcB/s1600/ttc_map.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="163" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OiNtxiqC4bw/WO7BxHe4NfI/AAAAAAAABnc/A09ANKGscKgG-PJ-NmVXlLJb98QXGQVegCPcB/s200/ttc_map.PNG" width="200" /></a></div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Now,
    while the most memorable levels from this genre typically followed this
    design, there were exceptions.&nbsp; SM64 featured levels like "Big Boo's 
    Haunt", which took place inside a haunted mansion, or "Hazy Maze Cave", 
    which lives up to it's name.&nbsp; Banjo-Kazooie had Gobi's Valley and Rusty 
    Bucket Bay, both of which had many smaller stages/puzzles that took 
    place indoors, separated from the overall perspective of the stage.&nbsp; 
    While these may have been considered to be refreshing changes of pace 
    from the typical stage layout, they are often lauded even by the most 
    devoted of fans, as it provides a disconnect from the spatial awareness 
    that the player draws in their mind as they explore the landscape. <br />
    <br />
    This is also the case with <b>Glitterglaze Glacier</b>,
    as much of the level takes place within caves or the Isymetric Castle. 
    &nbsp;In this manner, the majority of the world's landmarks and challenges 
    are connected by a series of doors and bridges, rather than being a part
    of an interconnected loop. &nbsp;In many ways, this instills the feeling 
    that Glitterglaze Glacier was built on the fly, with a little less 
    deliberation in design than Tribalstack Tropics.<br />
    <br />
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Gne0kD4QSgs/WQj6dpLuGGI/AAAAAAAABs4/w0oEsLxMAVcZFnYmb0XUGS4meTIkJnf5ACLcB/s1600/Capture.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="392" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Gne0kD4QSgs/WQj6dpLuGGI/AAAAAAAABs4/w0oEsLxMAVcZFnYmb0XUGS4meTIkJnf5ACLcB/s640/Capture.PNG" width="640" /></a></div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Moodymaze Marsh</b>
    takes this a step further, removing a central landmark from the world 
    altogether, and limiting the draw distance to challenge the player's 
    navigational skills.&nbsp; This is, of course, deliberate, as the name of the
    stage itself suggests a disorienting perspective. &nbsp;The designer 
    balances this a bit through the use of pipe-tunnels that can be used as a
    sort of fast-travel to areas you have managed to find in the past. 
    &nbsp;However, this provides a similar disconnectedness that is present in 
    Glitterglaze Glacier - a sort of incomplete logic in the map layout. 
    &nbsp;Ultimately, I found myself wanting to spend as little time here as 
    possible, as I became more and more frustrated when trying to keep track
    of where I've been.<br />
    <br />
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

    <br /></div>
    <br />
    <b>Capital Cashino</b>
    steps back to the "circular theme park" layout, with a few rooms 
    branching off that feature their own puzzles and challenges.&nbsp; At the 
    center of this map is a theme-appropriate water fountain featuring a lot
    of... character.<br />
    <br />
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MlbKCNsIh4s/WQ4S59NveVI/AAAAAAAABt0/tWTnb5k-A-oe0He_tRtYUTnmi-7i0s1wQCLcB/s1600/Capture.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="220" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MlbKCNsIh4s/WQ4S59NveVI/AAAAAAAABt0/tWTnb5k-A-oe0He_tRtYUTnmi-7i0s1wQCLcB/s320/Capture.PNG" width="320" /></a></div>
    <br />
    Returning
    to this style of map design, paired with the highly characteristic 
    landmarks (by way of artwork, props, architecture, and 
    puzzles/challenges), gave the impression of an arcade, where the playing
    and completing these games and challenges are more emphasized than the 
    act of exploring.<br />
    <br />
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OT2C0An8DjA/WQzqV0v4iqI/AAAAAAAABts/RiAsfC_ZPNEwxApEVxNJXrJYwjkbesaAwCPcB/s1600/Capture.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="248" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OT2C0An8DjA/WQzqV0v4iqI/AAAAAAAABts/RiAsfC_ZPNEwxApEVxNJXrJYwjkbesaAwCPcB/s400/Capture.PNG" width="400" /></a></div>
    <br />
    <br />
    The final stage before battling Capital B, <b>Galleon Galaxy </b>returns
    to the bridge-building design that we encountered in Glitterglaze 
    Glacier, but in a manner that suits the overall theme of the stage.&nbsp; 
    Points of interest on the map are separated by a cosmic ocean, which can
    be traversed by flight or by teleportation.&nbsp; As each landmark is large 
    and just kind of floating out in space, it is rather difficult to get 
    lost, but you are still met with an impression of openness and majesty 
    on your first visit.<br />
    <br />
    <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WKESBqhcSco/WQ63xx5PFSI/AAAAAAAABuE/7Zar1-zUCYs1MOjAisdO2OO79bKNe9W-ACLcB/s1600/Capture.PNG" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="198" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WKESBqhcSco/WQ63xx5PFSI/AAAAAAAABuE/7Zar1-zUCYs1MOjAisdO2OO79bKNe9W-ACLcB/s320/Capture.PNG" width="320" /></a>Similar
    also to Glitterglaze Glacier, much of the play space in Galleon Galaxy 
    is actually separated from the outside space in which you begin.&nbsp; Many 
    challenges and puzzles take place inside of one of the many landmarks 
    that populate the map, but they are self-contained.&nbsp; Having one entrance
    and one exit for a room with a single challenge allows the player to 
    keep better track of where they have been and what they have 
    accomplished. What is jarring about these rooms, however, is how large 
    and displaced they may seem - a small meteor holds a massive golf course
    puzzle, a massive moon holds a rather average sized sliding challenge.<br />

    of course, was not necessarily an issue in previous adventures.&nbsp; The 
    anthill in Mumbo's mountain was much larger on the inside than outside, 
    as was The Salty Hippo in Treasure Trove Cove.&nbsp; Even reaching the top of
    Grunty's Castle, when you think about it, didn't make a whole lot of 
    sense.&nbsp; However, in one way or another, you made your way through these 
    rooms with some logical sense.&nbsp; You start at the base of the anthill, 
    and travel upwards, while the interior gets narrower and narrower; the 
    Salty Hippo was partially flooded after being beached, so the player 
    would have to jump atop floating boxes or swim to the floor to gather 
    Blubber's gold.&nbsp; In Yooka-Laylee, it felt like most of the rooms that 
    branched away from the rest of the level didn't provide any natural 
    guidance.&nbsp; The Isymetric Castle, while an interesting concept, seemed 
    like it was intended to be it's own world altogether, continuing on and 
    on and making it easy for the player to lose track of where they've 
    been.&nbsp; The rooms of Galleon Galaxy felted simply like detached rooms 
    that really only kept the theme of the stage, rather than utilizing the 
    spherical shape of the structures in which they were placed or playing 
    with gravity.<br />
    <br />
    It is worth noting that before entering Galleon Galaxy, Yooka and Laylee are taught "Flappy Flight"&nbsp; which can be used at <i>any</i>
    time and lasts as long as your energy bar does.&nbsp; Granting this ability 
    at the end of the game simplifies a lot of the issues I had encountered 
    in the levels previously, and makes it a lot easier to search high and 
    low for those last few missing quills.&nbsp; The levels, for the most part, 
    were built with this in mind, as they permit a lot of vertical travel 
    space to the player.&nbsp; It's how I managed to get a lot of the screenshots
    for this blog post.<br />

    <span style="color: red;">&nbsp;<span style="color: white;">Mid-Level Context</span></span></h3>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;"><br /></span></span>
    <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;">The
    concept of Mid-Level Context observes the player's immediate 
    surroundings, referring to the objects that can be interacted with.&nbsp; 
    Swink suggests that when measuring this level of context, the designer 
    needs to examine 5 object traits:</span></span></div>
    <ul>
    <li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;">The Number of Objects</span></span></li>
    <li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;">The Size of Objects</span></span></li>
    <li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;">The Nature of Objects</span></span></li>
    <li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;">The Layout of Objects</span></span></li>
    <li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;">The Distance Between Objects</span></span></li>
    </ul>
    <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;">The
    use of the term "object" can be rather broad when talking about the 
    free-range platformer.&nbsp; The first things that may come to mind are the 
    collectibles that populate your path, or the number of enemies that will
    get in your way.&nbsp; It can, however, even refer to simple static 
    obstacles, like platforms or walls, that require a little added 
    maneuverability to get around.&nbsp; In a genre that prioritizes movement and
    navigation above all else, it would be fair to say that the feel of 
    this level of context is extremely important to the impression a world 
    leaves on the player.</span></span></div>

    <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;"><br /></span></span></div>
    <div>
    <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;">Swink
    relates this level of context to his experience playing World of 
    Warcraft; his traveling experience in WoW is compared to a long drive 
    between cities, where a lack of scenery or change in direction result in
    "highway hypnosis". &nbsp;He states, "Across multiple games, we can compare 
    how far apart objects are spaced relative to the speed and motion of the
    avatar and can examine how this changes game feel". Swink later points 
    out one of the biggest factors that benefited the feel of Super Mario 64
    was the manner in which object placement was tuned to Mario's jump 
    heights and trajectories, and how these relationships are presented to 
    the player throughout the game "regardless of what else is going on in 
    the level".&nbsp; To put it a little more simply, you can get an impression 
    of this level of context based upon the 5 traits in relation to the 
    abilities of the avatar. </span></span><br />
    <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;"><br /></span></span>
    With Yooka-Laylee providing such an arsenal of abilities the player can 
    use, utilizing each one in a meaningful way when the player is exploring
    a level can get very tricky. &nbsp;A prime example of what this could look 
    like, however, can bee seen in the very simplistic formula presented by 
    Prospect's "<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/512300/Unbox/" target="_blank">Unbox</a>".<br />
    <br />
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-s0Z5kx1k24Q/WR8kGCspzbI/AAAAAAAABwQ/HjQRTJAKxmIwHimGutUvCdZNton3FHmWACPcB/s1600/d88a10_384432e13f6d480386d4581583c6875f-mv2.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-s0Z5kx1k24Q/WR8kGCspzbI/AAAAAAAABwQ/HjQRTJAKxmIwHimGutUvCdZNton3FHmWACPcB/s400/d88a10_384432e13f6d480386d4581583c6875f-mv2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <i>From Unbox's press kit.</i></div>
    <br />
    I've
    come to look at this game as the Goat Simulator of 3D Platformers - it 
    is simple, with a lot to do, and by no means a perfect game, but I've 
    found a lot of joy in it regardless. &nbsp;What Unbox did so brilliantly is 
    strip platforming mechanics back down to their basics and exaggerating 
    them. &nbsp;You have the clumsy action of rolling a box around on the ground,
    and the ability to "unbox" yourself up to 6 times, which essentially 
    means that the player has 6 extra jumps that you can perform in mid air.
    &nbsp;Pair these abilities with the appropriate balance of physics code, and
    you have a really satisfying avatar that is difficult to master.<br />
    <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l2dXUAh8jZs/WR8ljErIlFI/AAAAAAAABwI/DVHd7kMPYuYNXb7JxysveUK8vHFjsF0cQCLcB/s1600/GIF.gif" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="151" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l2dXUAh8jZs/WR8ljErIlFI/AAAAAAAABwI/DVHd7kMPYuYNXb7JxysveUK8vHFjsF0cQCLcB/s200/GIF.gif" width="200" /></a><br />
    <br />
    What
    is great about this exaggeration of basic abilities, however, is that 
    it allowed the designers to create massive, sprawling worlds for each 
    level. &nbsp;At least, they only appear massive in relation to your size as a
    cardboard box. &nbsp;The ability to fly through the air using fans or your 
    hexa-jump(?) allows you to cross these worlds in a matter of
    seconds. &nbsp;These added jumps allow the player to make-up for misjudged 
    jumps or falling off the path, accounting for the unfamiliar sensation 
    of trying to roll a box along a path.<br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;">Although
    Swink has stated multiple times in his book that context can only be 
    measured as a soft metric, this put the thought in my head that I could 
    measure object-in-level density by simply traveling across a level in a 
    straight line, using the fastest method of transportation Y-L would 
    currently have, measuring how much change in controller input is 
    required.</span></span></div>
    <div>
    <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: white;"><br /></span></span>
    This concept is by no means scientific, so take the following with a 
    grain of salt. &nbsp;However, the results that I saw were of interest to me. 
    &nbsp;When traveling in a straight line on Tribalstack Tropics, I never found
    myself holding a steady course for more than <i>10</i> seconds when 
    using the roll, a move that I would find myself using often to make my 
    travel time as short as possible (given to the player before entering 
    Level 1). &nbsp;Utilizing the fastest method available to the player for this
    measurement is important because, as previously quoted, the spacing of 
    objects and it's effect of game feel is dependent largely on the speed 
    at which the avatar can move.<br />
    <br /></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PJoudtMpWSI/WQIvZHjuX4I/AAAAAAAABsA/s-tHXqmoctoejIB8DdwXNGliCUYU34nAQCPcB/s1600/dead_space.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="396" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PJoudtMpWSI/WQIvZHjuX4I/AAAAAAAABsA/s-tHXqmoctoejIB8DdwXNGliCUYU34nAQCPcB/s640/dead_space.PNG" width="640" /></a>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>
    Compare
    that time of 10 seconds in Tribalstack Tropics to the length of time it
    took me to traverse the lake in the image above (in Glitterglaze 
    Glacier), which took approximately&nbsp;<i>45</i> seconds (accomplished by 
    frequently double jumping out of the water to cover ground a bit faster 
    than by swimming). &nbsp;There are a few scattered jellyfish lurking beneath 
    the surface, but if you are simply trying to cross the map, they won't 
    give you much trouble.&nbsp; There is, of course, an icy path of floating 
    platforms that you could use to cross.&nbsp; But providing only one pathway 
    across a vast void like this one is too linear of a solution.<br />
    <br />
    What
    should be used to fill these voids?&nbsp; Typically, the types of objects 
    that populate Yooka-Laylee's game space are collectibles, enemies, or 
    platforms (not really counting the NPCs and their challenges).&nbsp; The 
    combination of these items strike an interesting balance of "pleasure 
    seeking" and "pain avoidance"; collecting items provides the player with
    a small reward, usually in the form of fanfare or a point increase, 
    while platforms or enemies can break rhythm and flow, encouraging the 
    player to further master their control and timing of actions the avatar 
    can take.<br />
    <br />
    Tribalstack Tropics offered a near-perfect 
    balance between these two sensations in a space that felt open with a 
    lot of room for maneuverability.&nbsp;&nbsp; The important thing to note, however,
    is how the placement of these objects created a space that was neither 
    claustrophobic, nor barren.&nbsp; Object placement in this manner allows the 
    player to think about the space as a whole and reflect on where they 
    need to go next, while simultaneously focused on the obstacle that lies 
    directly ahead of them.&nbsp; Going back through the level and trying to find
    those last few notes doesn't necessarily become much of a chore, as the
    level of attentiveness required of the player to simply traverse the 3D
    space is enough to keep them from getting bored, but not too much to be
    a burden.<br />

    <br />
    Playtonic
    did break some of the conventions that we saw in the free-range 
    platformer of the 1990's, however. &nbsp;In the above image, you can see that
    the placement of quills, the more common collectible item, isn't 
    reserved specifically to platforms or paths that players are expected to
    take. &nbsp;They are often found obstacles that might usually be treated as 
    walls rather than platforms; something to simply avoid rather than 
    climb. &nbsp;This, in a way, breaks the conventional boundary and gives the 
    player freedom to explore <i>every inch</i> of the world no matter the terrain.&nbsp; We'll look at the effect this has on boundaries with a bit more detail later on.<br />
    <br />
    By
    using quills to suggest this level of freedom, however, these "common" 
    collectibles become hard to find rather quickly. &nbsp;With a set number of 
    quills established for every stage (excluding Hivory Towers), they can 
    feel pretty scarce when you're sticking to the path.<br />
    <br />
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">
    Low-Level Context</h3>
    <br />
    Low-level context is concerned with 
    the avatar's personal space; the way in which the player can interact 
    with object and collision code.&nbsp; In his analysis of Super Mario 64, 
    Swink mostly addresses how Mario interacts with the ground under his 
    feet.&nbsp; Designers used steep inclines to make Mario lose his footing and 
    slide, which is applied both as a way to mark boundaries and as a new 
    way to control his movements.&nbsp; Once more, the emphasis on this kind of 
    interaction makes sense in a game where movement is key, and the 
    challenges in Yooka-Laylee are designed with this in mind.<br />
    <br />
    Momentum
    and friction are both simulated in a logical manner (at least, with 
    regards to interactions with common terrain and platforms).&nbsp; Slopes and 
    inclines get a little weird, however, as what is defined as "slippery" 
    is not based purely on steepness.&nbsp; Some slopes of similar degree can be 
    walked on, some require rolling, and some require rolling plus a 
    power-up, like honey.&nbsp; There really isn't much of a way to determine 
    which of these are necessary until you simply attempt the climb.&nbsp; 
    Slippery slopes in SM64 were based purely on the degree of steepness, 
    which the player could judge after becoming acclimated to the game's 
    physical rules.<br />
    <br />
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

    <br />
    The
    "Reptile Role" is a move considered to be the successor to the "Talon 
    Trot" in Banjo-Kazooie, with a bit more speed and the ability to knock 
    back enemies that come into contact. &nbsp;Both of these moves are acquired 
    very early in the game, and are often relied on by the average player to
    traverse through a course quickly. &nbsp;While Talon Trot was quick, it was 
    also precise in control; the player had the ability to make sharp turns 
    and stop on a dime, while climbing nearly any surface. &nbsp;Reptile Roll 
    sought to balance this by countering the aforementioned speed boost and 
    knock-back capability with controls that felt a little more slippery and
    hard to control with precision. &nbsp;By creating a mode of transport in 
    this manner, Playtonic has ensured versatility in game play, so that no 
    single moveset is favored.<br />

    Boundary Play</h3>

    sees these extreme angles in SM64 as a soft boundary, a "gentle 
    negative reinforcement with a clear, physical relationship".&nbsp; In other 
    words, it's a not-so-punishing way of saying "turn around".&nbsp; Boundaries 
    in Y-L are treated quite differently.&nbsp; In Tribalstack Tropics, they 
    almost don't exist whatsoever.&nbsp; As I mentioned in the section regarding 
    Low-Level Context, climbing objects that aren't platforms is encouraged 
    (boulders in this case), and the edges of the world are marked with 
    those objects.</div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br /></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    While
    this instills a feeling of openness to the stage, playing with these 
    boundaries can easily result in death-by-void, and even if you are 
    skilled enough to traverse the outermost edges of the map, you'll 
    discover that there isn't really much waiting for you.</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <br /></div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    Moodymaze
    Marsh and Galleon Galaxy, on the other hand, employ the old "floor is 
    lava" technique, where rather than falling to your death, the player is 
    given a chance to turn tail and get back to the intended play space.&nbsp; 
    While this is less harsh of a punishment, the Marsh's lowered draw 
    distance would consistently entice me into thinking that there might be 
    more ahead of me, if I could find a way across this hazardous waste.</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    <br /></div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    The
    above is, of course, only addressing boundaries on the horizontal 
    axis.&nbsp; Boundaries below the player either end at your feet, or somewhere
    below the course, watching for you to fall into the void.&nbsp; A boundary 
    above you is usually just a ceiling that stops any further ascension.&nbsp; 
    The ceiling of each stage in Y-L is set pretty high to accommodate the 
    grand scale of structures and landmarks (see previous screenshots), and 
    with the end-game ability of Flappy Flight, these generous barriers 
    offer some interesting perches (again, see previous screenshots).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

    one and only place where vertical travel feels more limited is in 
    Glitterglaze Glacier; the ceiling is noticeably lower, and forbids the 
    player to reach vantage points of interest. &nbsp;Not only that, but rather 
    than being a solid wall of collision, the ceiling will actually push the
    avatar back down, a kind of jarring way of saying "No Trespassing". &nbsp;I 
    couldn't help but get the feeling that this particular ceiling, combined
    with the variance in low-level context between the avatar and other 
    objects, demonstrated a lack on uniformity of rule sets between 
    stages.</div>

    Conclusion</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
    <br /></div>
    <div>
    Upon reviewing 
    everything I discussed in the above paragraphs, it feels more like I 
    just spent a lot of time picking apart the things I didn't like about 
    Yooka-Laylee rather than answer the question I posed in the 
    introduction. &nbsp;Truthfully, many of these details are just that - small 
    details of a bigger picture. &nbsp;Playtonic sought to revive the 3D 
    Platforming genre by adapting the original formula into modern-day 
    gaming, and they accomplished this by creating captivating worlds that 
    were massive and packed with things to do. &nbsp;They weren't perfect, as you
    will no doubt see in reviews on Metacritic, but they were a good 
    starting point. &nbsp;Tribalstack Tropics specifically will go down as one of
    the most entertaining virtual spaces I have explored in a long while.</div>
    <div>
    <br /></div>
    <div>
    This
    research was a really fascinating crash course on 3D level design, 
    especially for games where exploration is key. &nbsp;I aim to use what I 
    learned from Schell and Swink in my future analysis of games and in my 
    own designs as well. &nbsp;For now, it's time to spend a little less studying
    design and actually get my hands dirty.</div>

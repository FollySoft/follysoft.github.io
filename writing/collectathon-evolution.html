    The early reviews of Yooka-Laylee have been pouring in (prior to it's
     April 11th release date), and the results have been rather polarized.<br />

    Many
     reviews have praised the game as a proper "return to form", being a 
    true spiritual-successor to Banjo-Kazooie.&nbsp; Others have found the game 
    to be far too dated, stating that the game carried issues back from the 
    N64 era. &nbsp;I have often considered Banjo-Kazooie to be one of my favorite
     games of all time; it is the game that got me into games in the first 
    place. &nbsp;So I had to ask myself: Is there really any room for the 
    original 3D Platformer/Collect-athon style in this day and age? &nbsp;Could a
     game like Yooka-Laylee offer more than just a nostalgia trip?<br />

    <u>Where it Started</u></h2>
    <br />
    Or, at least, where it became 
    popular. &nbsp;The 1990 MS-DOS game "Alpha Waves" is credited as being the 
    first 3D Platform game to exist. &nbsp;But it can be argued that the newly-imagined Super 
    Mario of the mid 90's truly defined the genre.<br />
    <br />
    With
     the release of the Nintendo 64 in Japan back in 1996, the console's 
    64-bit processing power, paired with the introduction of 360Â° control 
    via thumbstick, offered a brand new experience for gamers and developers
     alike. &nbsp;While developers had the ability to use the N64's processing 
    power to create new and exciting 3D landscapes, &nbsp;the addition 
    of&nbsp;precision control within these open environments gave player complete
     freedom of movement, encouraging exploration and non-linear navigation 
    to get from "Point A" to "Point B". &nbsp;This innovation in control would be
     demonstrated by the N64's flagship title: <i>Super Mario 64.</i><br />

    This
     new and exciting take on the Super Mario franchise was met with 
    outstanding reviews, welcoming the birth of the 3D platformer into the 
    industry. &nbsp;Publications and websites including IGN, Edge Magazine, EGM, 
    Gamespot, and Famitsu all reviewed SM64 with near-perfect scores.<br />
    <blockquote>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <i>"Not
     only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of 
    visual finesse, it plays just as well if not infinitely better than 
    previous 2D incarnations of the Mario franchise... More freedom, more 
    space, more options, better graphics, improved and elaborated control 
    schemes -- it's all there.&nbsp;</i><i>" </i><br />
    <i>- IGN</i></blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <i>"With
     realms so vast and detailed, and yet so graphically clean and simple, 
    one instinctively wants to go exploring: What's just beyond that rise? 
    Who's peeking at me from behind that wall? How can I get to that far 
    ridge, that seemingly inaccessible platform, that island floating 
    unsupported in the air? ...If Mario 64 is even a rough indication of 
    what's to be expected from Nintendo, or from games in general, then we 
    just might have a revolution of sorts in our very hands." </i><br />
    <i>- Gamespot</i></blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    While
     the reviewers of this time talked-up the revolutionary open-world 
    format of SM64's level design as well as it's graphical beauty, they by 
    no means skipped over the new mechanics that were being introduced to 
    gaming: freedom of movement and freedom of camera control.&nbsp; "A 
    revolution of sorts" in the palms of our hands.<br />

     is pretty well known for his jump. &nbsp;It was his primary action in the 
    original Donkey Kong arcade cabinet, and it is his primary action in 
    Nintendo's first mobile game, Super Mario Run, that released earlier 
    this year. &nbsp;It is this jump that founded the platformer genre in the 
    1980's. &nbsp;It then comes as no surprise that his acrobatic ability became 
    the focal point for his introduction into the 3D plane; pairing the 
    precision of the thumbstick with a variety of button presses gave Mario a
     pretty extensive variety of moves.</div>

    </div>
    Placing
     the player on a 3D plane also brings the viewpoint into question. 
    &nbsp;Until this point, the typical platform game used a fixed camera angle, 
    as the player only had to move on a 2-dimensional plane. With the 
    importance of precision control in platforming games, the player needed 
    to be able to see <b>exactly </b>where each of their jumps would land. 
    &nbsp;Naturally, having a 3rd Dimension made this difficult, but the 
    developers of the 90s accounted for it in many ways: &nbsp;Mario 64 not only 
    pioneered the use of a smart, dynamic camera, but also gave the player 
    some control over their view; using the 4 C-Buttons on the controller 
    moved the camera left and right, as well as allowed the player to zoom 
    in or out for a better look at their surroundings. &nbsp;While far from 
    perfect, the use of the C-Buttons in this manner would precursor the 
    second analog stick that most controllers use today.<br />

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <b><i>Pulled Punches</i></b></div>
    <br />
    Though
     this style of control was unfamiliar to gamers in 1996, it didn't take 
    too long to master the fluidity of Mario's movements. &nbsp;It is worth 
    noting, however, that combat has taken a back seat; the 'B' button 
    provides a 3-punch/kick combo that can only be used if Mario is standing
     still, and there are no fire flowers to provide the player with the 
    trademark Fireball attack.&nbsp; The basic attack required the player to be <i>facing the right direction</i>, and they had to <i>rely purely on timing</i>.
     The combat moves that sees far more usage are the ones that encourage 
    the player to keep moving - jumps, ground pounds, and dives are far more
     commonly used by the experienced player rather then stationary punches.<br />
    <br />
    And
     continuous motion is part of the point. &nbsp;While it was understandable at
     the time to stop and take in these beautiful 3D landscapes and vibrant 
    colors, Nintendo wanted the player to explore these landscapes and see 
    what they had to offer. &nbsp;It is here that <b><i>collecting</i></b> becomes an important aspect of the 3D Platformer.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">
    <u>Collect-athon</u></h2>
    <div>
    <br /></div>
    Super Mario 64 had the
     player progress by collecting power stars. &nbsp;These stars were often 
    rewards for various tasks or challenges; such as racing an NPC or 
    fighting a boss. &nbsp;Stars were also hidden in the stage, and rewarded when
     the player collected all 100 coins. &nbsp;The player is not given a lot of 
    direction when pursuing a challenge star, only a somewhat vague title 
    for the assigned task like "<i>SHOOT TO THE ISLAND IN THE SKY</i>" or "<i>BIG BOB-OMB ON THE SUMMIT</i>". &nbsp;You would have to <b>jump into the world and explore</b>, putting the puzzle pieces together for yourself.<br />
    <br />
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mu3ojbvgpBg/WO-HmApqg6I/AAAAAAAABns/puamTQYHuTkH5v6srfUFx0Z06DyqMUxIgCLcB/s1600/Capture.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="111" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mu3ojbvgpBg/WO-HmApqg6I/AAAAAAAABns/puamTQYHuTkH5v6srfUFx0Z06DyqMUxIgCLcB/s320/Capture.PNG" width="320" /></a></div>
    <br />
    Not
     long after the release of SM64, the public saw the release of numerous 
    games that adapted their own variations on this design. &nbsp;Banjo-Kazooie 
    and Donkey Kong 64 are typically the games that come to mind when the 
    term "collect-athon" is mentioned, as they put item hunting at the 
    center of gameplay. &nbsp;Typically, these items had a varying amount of 
    rarity attached to them, and each were used to progress the game in one 
    way or another.<br />
    <br />
    <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rHlO95Z7NZc/WO-IjS5_RlI/AAAAAAAABn4/9EDBT132xYcGwKxH92CJbm_kfkgBWHyvgCLcB/s1600/Capture.PNG" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="193" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rHlO95Z7NZc/WO-IjS5_RlI/AAAAAAAABn4/9EDBT132xYcGwKxH92CJbm_kfkgBWHyvgCLcB/s200/Capture.PNG" width="200" /></a>Take
     Banjo-Kazooie as an example: &nbsp;Jiggys are usually at the top of the list
     to collect, as they allow you to open up new stages to explore. &nbsp;These 
    Jiggys can be found on their own or obtained through challenges, but 
    they could also be obtained by finding and collecting the Jinjos that 
    were placed at the far corners of the stage. &nbsp;Some of those 
    aforementioned challenges might require a transformation from Mumbo, but
     he would only oblige if you have collected the proper amount of skull 
    tokens. &nbsp;Even when this is all said and done, in order to further 
    progress through Grunty's castle, a large number music notes would need 
    to be collected. &nbsp;On paper, this sounds like a lot of unnecessary work. 
    &nbsp;However, the manner in which these items are placed is what makes the 
    item hunting objective worthwhile.<br />
    <br />
    <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Kugv_gKDy0/WO-ZAUwe6II/AAAAAAAABoI/2lsr5YQ2Hhgm6OlkxXbmYveqd79GEKKBgCLcB/s1600/Capture.PNG" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="237" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Kugv_gKDy0/WO-ZAUwe6II/AAAAAAAABoI/2lsr5YQ2Hhgm6OlkxXbmYveqd79GEKKBgCLcB/s320/Capture.PNG" width="320" /></a><br />
    <b>Notes</b>
     are often the first item the player would see. &nbsp;Typically, they are 
    placed in a straight line along a path or route, beckoning the player to
     continue in a particular direction. &nbsp;<b>Jinjos</b> are less common. 
    &nbsp;They can usually be found in isolated parts of the map, like out in the
     middle of a body of water or at the top of a mountain. &nbsp;While not quite
     hidden from view, the Jinjo hunt encourages more exploration than 
    notes, requiring the player to travel and search each part of the map. 
    &nbsp;The rarest item, the <b>Mumbo Token</b>, is akin to the loose change that falls between the couch cushions. &nbsp;Banjo has to check <i>every nook and cranny</i> to find these tokens.<br />
    <br />
    For
     most, there is an addictive quality of collecting each of these tokens.
     &nbsp;Every item that you pick up is accompanied by a little fanfare and an 
    increase in score/item count/health, an immediate indicator that you 
    were progressing in one manner or another. &nbsp;You are being rewarded for 
    exploring an interesting, new, fantastical space. &nbsp;Bonus points.<br />
    <br />
    The take away? &nbsp;<i><b>Collectibles that serve the purpose of progression for the player were used as a means of exploration by the developer.</b>&nbsp; </i>This
     revolutionary technological shift opened up a whole new world of 
    creativity for game designers, and they wanted to make sure that the 
    player had the opportunity to see every last bit of it.<br />
    <br />
    There
     is, of course, the possibility of taking collecting a step too far.&nbsp; 
    This was the lament of many critics and gamers alike when <i>Donkey Kong 64</i>
     was released.&nbsp; Similar to Power Stars and Jiggys, the most important 
    treasure to the DK Crew was the Golden Banana, which allowed the player 
    to progress and open up more worlds.&nbsp; But there's a bit more to the game
     than that...<br />
    <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <i>...there's plenty more to collect: regular bananas, fairies (which
     you must take pictures of with a camera), banana medals, super-secret 
    Rareware coins, blueprint pieces (found by defeating certain enemies), 
    crowns (to unlock multiplayer games) and boss keys (to unlock new areas 
    on the island). Now, <u>factor in that each of the five characters must 
    find some of these items individually</u>: Devoted gamers will see this as 
    added replay value, while others will see it as a royal pain in the 
    Donkey derriere.</i> <i>- Gamespot</i></blockquote>

    <br />
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    It is important to note, however, that no matter how many collectibles were available in each stage,&nbsp;<i><b>not everything needed to be collected for the player to progress</b></i>.
     &nbsp;In fact, the percentage of what was needed to progress through a games
     hub world starts low and gets higher, encouraging the player to go back
     and look for the things they may have missed as they approach the end 
    game. &nbsp;</div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br /></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
    For
     example, in order to fight "Bowser in the Dark World" and get the key 
    to move up to the second floor of Peach's Castle, Mario would have to 
    collect a minimum of 8 stars, when there are 28 available within the 
    first few stages (~%30). &nbsp;Compare this to the final fight with Rainbow 
    Bowser, when 70 stars are required of the 118 available (including 
    castle secret stars). &nbsp;Now, the player needs to have at least %60 of the
     stars collected before "finishing" the game.</div>

    <u>Evolution</u></h2>
    <b><u><br /></u></b>
    <b><u>1996-2000</u></b> <br />
    <b><u><br /></u></b>
    The late 90's saw it's fair share of games that followed the 3D 
    Collect-athon formula.&nbsp; After Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie, we had 
    classics like Donkey Kong 64, Spyro the Dragon, Glover, and Gex: Enter 
    the Gecko.&nbsp; Each of these games took the 3D platform model and added 
    their own personal touches to it, expanding the variety of the genre 
    more and more.<br />
    <br />
    Oddly enough,&nbsp; the more complexity a new
     game added to the genre, the less it felt like a platform game.&nbsp; Some 
    games made a point to continuously add moves or power ups as the player 
    progressed, offering up new puzzles and challenges in newer levels.&nbsp; A 
    few hours of Banjo-Kazooie felt more like spending a day at the Fair or 
    at Chuck E Cheese - maps tended to be circular in nature, with a 
    different challenges placed frequently along the path that required the 
    mastery of some skill or move that you learned not long ago.&nbsp; You could 
    relate this to, say, walking past BB gun shooting ranges or ring toss 
    games as you try to win a stuffed animal for your date.&nbsp; That's not to 
    say that platforming disappeared completely - 
    the player still had to seek out and navigate to these challenges 
    themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    <br />

    <div style="text-align: left;">
    Donkey
     Kong 64, on the other hand, took the focus even further from 
    platforming into expanding the capabilities of the player, through the 
    introduction of the "DK Crew". &nbsp;As previously mentioned, the level of 
    collecting in this game was much higher than that of the genre's 
    predecessors, but it also played heavy on the concept of replay-ability;
     &nbsp;more often than not, there were just certain puzzles or challenges 
    that you did not have the capability to solve quite yet, and you would 
    need to return some time in the future if you wanted to get that 
    particular Gold Banana.</div>

    <br />
    What
     we are witnessing during this time period is actually a slow shift away
     from the platforming aspect of the collect-athon and a turn to the 
    "Adventure" genre, where the focus shifts a little further away from 
    exploration and more on puzzle-solving and character interaction. &nbsp;Using
     Math Manent's&nbsp;<i>Nintendo 64 Anthology</i>, we can actually visualize this shift by the manner in which each of these games are listed by their genre:<br />
    <br />
    <ul>
    <li>Super Mario 64 &nbsp; &nbsp;- 3D Platformer/Adventure</li>
    <li>Glover &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 3D Platformer/Adventure</li>
    <li>Banjo Kazooie &nbsp; &nbsp; - Adventure/Platformer</li>
    <li>Donkey Kong 64 - Adventure/Platformer</li>
    </ul>
    In many ways, the light-hearted and colorful mood that would 
    typically accompany a game in this genre reflected this shift.&nbsp; There 
    was not a lot of depth to their stories, no complex relationships to 
    manage.&nbsp; The only interactions you really had between characters were 
    sarcastic dialogue or pun-heavy dad jokes. &nbsp;The focus at this time was 
    still on game play, and its why they are remembered so fondly.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b><u>2000-2003</u></b><br />
    <br />
    The
     year 2000 saw the release of the Playstation 2 (followed closely by the
     XBox and GameCube), and with it, another significant shift in 
    processing power for the game industry.&nbsp; The system could handle a much 
    higher polygon count, offering more detailed graphics and animations, 
    and it could handle massive, sprawling worlds compared to the consoles

     Naughty Dog introduced a brand new dynamic duo and a brand new colorful
     world to explore, sticking close to the format of 3D Platform/Adventure
     games from previous years. &nbsp;All of Jak's moves were usable from the 
    beginning: double jumps, high jumps, rolling jumps, spin kicking and 
    dash punches, just to name a few. &nbsp;The only way in which game play could
     change is if the player absorbed "Eco", which provided Jak with a speed
     boost or the ability to use fireballs for a short while.<br />
    <br />
    Jak
     and Daxter utilized a similar collecting model to Banjo-Kazzoie; 
    precursor orbs were very common, and were often used as a means of 
    suggesting to the player what paths they could take. &nbsp;Scout Flies 
    equated to Jinjos, as they were hidden about each level. &nbsp;When they were
     found, the player is rewarded with a power cell. &nbsp;Power Cells, as you 
    can probably guess, are the Golden Banana/Jiggy/Power Star of the 
    previous generation; you can only progress when you have gathered enough
     of these. &nbsp;And as before, only a certain percentage of these needed to 
    be collected to proceed.<br />
    <br />
    Even though these designs feel
     familiar, Naughty Dog took full advantage of the new technology at hand
     to "modernize" the 3D platformer. &nbsp;Jak and Daxter is listed in the 
    Guinness World Records as the first game to create a "<a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-seamless-3d-world-in-a-console-game" target="_blank">seamless 3D world in a console video game</a>",
     and it's effects on players were very clear. &nbsp;While the world of Jak 
    and Daxter was still divided between levels and a hub, the fluidity in 
    which the player could traverse between the two made the flow of 
    exploration all the more natural. <br />

    During
     this time, we see the fantastic return of old characters, as well as 
    the introduction of new ones, all of which use the new graphical 
    processing power at hand to extraordinary lengths. &nbsp;We have already met 
    Jak and Daxter (2001), but not long after we find Mario in his new 
    adventure, Super Mario Sunshine (2002), and we get to meet newcomers 
    Ratchet and Clank (2002) and Sly Cooper (2002). <br />
    <br />
    Each 
    of these followed a simpler collect-athon pattern, balancing the rewards
     between progression and "powering-up" the character:<br />
    <br />
    <ul>
    <li>Ratchet and Clank offered up a variety of weapons and gadgets that 
    can be purchased by collecting bolts, placing more focus on action and 
    shooting in the platformer genre.</li>
    <li>Sly Cooper introduced stealth into platforming, offering an amusing 
    way to interact with the environment. &nbsp;Sly could collect notes that were
     hidden within each course that would offer upgrades once they were all 
    collected, including new moves and abilities that are not necessary to 
    progress, but can improve the way the player navigates the course.</li>
    <li>Super Mario Sunshine once more had Mario collecting stars (or 
    Sprites, in this case). &nbsp;However, this time there was a bit more story 
    offered, and Mario is teamed up with FLUDD, an upgrade-able, robotic 
    backpack that shoots water.</li>
    </ul>

    While
     all of these games offered new takes on platforming, they too sought to
     utilize the new generation's hardware to it's furthest extent. &nbsp;The 
    update in graphics and animation gave the characters more life, and the 
    extensive writing and voice acting gave them personalities. &nbsp;Stories had
     much more significance, and trended towards being more mature in 
    nature.<br />

    In
     the wake of Grand Theft Auto III's release in 2001, open-world sandbox 
    games were on the rise. &nbsp;There are some who considered Jak II's release 
    in 2003 to signify the death of the 3D Platfomer Collect-athon, as it 
    turned away from the trends of the last generation toward a future with 
    even bigger worlds, more complex storylines, and the freedom to do just 
    about anything. &nbsp;There was the occasional Precursor Orb to gather, which
     would unlock bonus features from the developers, but it certainly 
    wasn't an objective for every player.<br />
    <br />
    As our 
    technological capabilities grow, so does this virtual playing field. 
    &nbsp;The AAA developers of today are looking to create as grand of an 
    experience as possible, with the likes of <i>The Elder Scrolls</i> and <i>Fallout</i> franchises offering the capability to live a second life within the vast world they've hand-crafted. &nbsp;<i>No Man's Sky</i>
     advertised a whole universe to explore, with 18.6 quintillion planets 
    to explore. &nbsp;These games offered beautiful scenery and a large map for 
    their stories to take place, but no real push to go out and explore, 
    save for the objective marker on your mini-map.<br />
    <br />
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <i>However, it turns out that the collect-athon of the 90's doesn't die quite so easily.</i></div>
    <i><br /></i>
    Nintendo has been a company that sticks close to their IPs, is still putting out fantastic Mario games. &nbsp;<i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> and <i>Super Mario Galaxy 2</i>,
     while a bit more linear in nature than their predecessors, offer a 
    fresh twist to platforming. &nbsp;And while AAA games have been following 
    their &nbsp;trends, the growing population of indie developers are bringing a
     whole new perspective to the table. &nbsp;Games like <i><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/544330/" target="_blank">Snake Pass</a>&nbsp;</i>look to put a new spin on player control. &nbsp;<i><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/390210/" target="_blank">FreezeME</a></i> added a new mechanic of freezing platforms and objects in their place for the player to use in their challenges. &nbsp;The cult hit&nbsp;<i><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/3830/" target="_blank">Psychonauts</a></i> brought brilliant, charming writing and original concepts to the table, as Raz navigates the minds of those around him.<br />
    <br />
    Coming later this year, we also have the much anticipated release of&nbsp;<i><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/253230/" target="_blank">A Hat in Time</a>,&nbsp;</i>a
     3D platformer that looks to stick close to the original model of Super 
    Mario 64, pairing the exploration of a vast, colorful world with a fun 
    and quirky attitude.<br />
    <br />
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    And, this week, we had the "Rare-vival" itself: <i>Yooka-Laylee.</i></div>

    This kickstarter project was created by the team originally behind 
    Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, who aimed to modernize the classic 3D 
    Platforming formula. &nbsp;Being more BK than DK, the game set aside story 
    for mechanics, creating a whole new set of moves for the player to learn
     with the goal of finding and collecting Pagies. &nbsp;However, instead of 
    having 9 or 10 varying levels for the player to explore, they chose to 
    develop 5 massive, expandable worlds that could take hours to complete -
     their own way of keeping up with the ever-expanding playing field.<br />
    <br />

    Conclusion</h2>
    Freedom in game design has a whole different 
    definition today than it did in 1996; &nbsp;simply breaking into the 3rd 
    dimension was more than enough to captivate the audience of the game 
    industry back then. &nbsp;But the 3D platformer was not just the gimmick of 
    the 1990s, it held a particular spirit of fun that many of us still 
    enjoy after 20 years of gaming. &nbsp;Here's to hoping that we see more from 
    the talented developers of today!<br />
    <i><br />*Taking the time to 
    research these games has taught me a lot regarding their design. &nbsp;I plan
     on writing a follow-up post that will explore these concepts much more 
    deeply.</i><br />

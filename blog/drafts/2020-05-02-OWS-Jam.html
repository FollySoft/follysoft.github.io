      <p>This is my inargural blog post on my new website!   I'm unsure how frequently I'll be making posts, but with the unhealthy state of social media platforms lately, I figured it was a good idea
        to try and start this up.  I'm starting off by chatting a little bit about the first <a href="https://itch.io/jam/open-world-shutter-community-jam-1" target="_blank">Open World Shutter Jam</a> 
        - a jam centered on the usage of the Open World Shutter software by Jonny Hopkins.  Below you'll find a dump of shots I managed to capture during the span on the jam, many of which were unsubmitted.  
        I've had so much fun with this lately that I had to try and limit myself on the number of entries I submitted for the jam...
      </p>

      <p>
        I had dabbled with the tool a little bit in the past when it was first released.  I have been following Jonny's work for a while - his work in the alt-ctrl games scene has been particularly inspirational to 
        much of my own work.  When this tool was released, I was knee-deep in Elden Ring, and the games beautifully erie aesthetic, paired the ability to diable the games HUD and use of the in-game telescope,
        it felt like the perfect place to test the waters.  Despite my love of photography as a hobby, I think this may have been the closest I've ever really come to actually playing with any sort of camera-related mode
        or tools in (or with) a game.

        Fez, another favorite game of mine, seemed like another natural fit for long-exposure fun.

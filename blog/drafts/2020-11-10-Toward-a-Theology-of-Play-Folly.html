    - Three posts a week, more or less.
    - One idea per post. If I find myself launching into another section, cut and paste the extra 
      into a separate draft post, and tie off the original one with the word “Anyway.” Then publish.
    - No hedging, no nuance. If I’m getting in a twist about a sentence, take it out.
    - Give up on attempting to be right.
    - Give up on providing full links and citations.
    - Give up on saying anything new. Most people haven’t read my old stuff. Play the hits.
    - Give up on trying to be popular. I try not to filter myself based on what I believe will be popular. 
      Some of my favourite posts get ignored. Some posts get popular and I have no idea why. Besides, 
      terrible posts get buried fast if I’m posting three times a week. So post with abandon.
    - Give up on trying to be interesting. Readers will come to my site for what’s interesting to me, or not, 
      it’s fine, just say what I think about whatever I’m thinking about.
    - But make it work for a general audience.
    - Only write what’s in my head at that exact moment. It’s 10x faster.
    - If it’s taking too long to write, stop.
    - Don’t use a post just to link to something elsewhere. If there’s a point to make, start with that.
    - Titles should be descriptive and have the flavour of the post. And rewrite the lede once the post 
      is done so the whole thing gets to the point faster.
    - It’s ok not to blog if it feels like a chore.
    - Writing is a muscle.

    "If I have an idea for a post, at any time, I make a note of it in my drafts folder – without delay. 
    Or it’ll disappear.

    When there’s time to write, I go through my draft posts (and recent links that I’ve run across, 
    I capture those too) and see if anything catches my eye. If it does: start typing and see what happens."

      <p>I started this draft this morning with the title "Toward a Theology of Play: Folly", while Discord is open on the monitor to my left.  In it, a member of the 
        <a href="https://www.cgdc.org/" target="_blank">CGDC</a> community has begun a poll with the title "WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE VIDEO GAMES?" listing 5 different options:
        <ul>
          <li>I love to be creative!! (currently 4 votes)</li>
          <li>I want to make a career out of it!! (currently 1 vote)</li>
          <li>I thrive on seeing a project finished. (currently 1 vote)</li>
          <li>I've always had this idea in my head... (currently 3 votes)</li>
          <li>[Other] (currently 1 vote)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I bring this up, however, is that a member of the community responded with this specific message, emphasis my own:
        <blockquote>
          Over the last decade I've worked in game dev I would have voted for each of those options at different times in life. <b>Ultimately they're all folly</b> if it isn't to serve a higher purpose and calling.
        </blockquote>
        The fact that these words were spoken, in this context, in the hours after I created this document with "Folly" within the title, felt like a sign that I needed to continue forward with discussing this
        topic, and the term "folly" in partuclar, within the contexts of creativity and Chritian theology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I changed a lot of my online handles to 'FollySoft'.  This word has held so much of my interest in the years following my initial desire to make games that I feel it's come to define 
        my very creative practice.  Once before, I attempted to write <a href="https://jwest.itch.io/a-creative-fools-manifesto" target="_blank">a manifesto</a> around the idea of "creative folly" with the
        assistance of a close friend who had also been thinking on the subject.  Yet I never really felt like it quite said what I hoped it would say.  So I feel it's time I looked at it from the biblical perspective
        in hopes that I can truely get a grasp of the paradoxical feelings we all have toward this word.
      </p>
      <p>
        An easy place to start is the bible.  Fools and folly are, by and large, not depicted in a favorable light in scripture, and rightfully so.

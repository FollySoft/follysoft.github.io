        It's been a bit of an odd for month for me since I last wrote in here, I've been struggling with this ongoing fatigue that has really kept me from
        maintaining any motivation to work on hobby prokects like this one.  Playing games or reading books during my own leisure time had even proven to be a bit 
        of a struggle.  This week, however, I've been docusing on trying to get more sun and deliberately take more leisure time, and I feel as though I'm on a bit of
        an upswing.  I'm trying to take advantage of this and get back into playing with this Perspectives game idea and documenting the process as I go along.

        In my <a href="https://jrcwest.github.io/blog/posts/2023-05-17-Pespectives-Game-Devlog-1.html" target="_blank">last post</a> I introduced the idea for this 
        Perspectives Game and some of the prototyping I had done so far with the ideas I had come up with.  Since then, I have been having some good
        conversations with a few folks in <a href="https://youcanneverleave.art/" target="_blank">Paradise</a> about some directions this could go as well as
        explore ideas for additional prompts.

        After some discussion I took some suggestions from <a href="https://paulby.itch.io/">Paulby</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jakeyouh">üå±üçÄüå≤</a> and added two new perspectives
        to the mix:
        <ul>
          <li>Excitable Dog</li>
          <li>Tourist</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My hope is that as you, the reader, saw these two new perspectives, that you might have asked yourself "What does taking pictures as an excitable dog look like?"
        Maybe you went so far as to imagine yourself as a tourist with a camera, taking a selfie or posing with points of interest around you.  Maybe you had a different
        idea altogether of what taking pictures as a tourist would look like.
      </p>
      <p>
        This brings me to a pretty important point in the discussions I've been having on discord: keeping these perspectives open to interpretation, rather than setting
        hard "rules" or "guidelines" that players <b>must</b> follow during their play sessions.

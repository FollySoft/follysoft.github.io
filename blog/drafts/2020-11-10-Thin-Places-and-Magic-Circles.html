    - Three posts a week, more or less.
    - One idea per post. If I find myself launching into another section, cut and paste the extra 
      into a separate draft post, and tie off the original one with the word “Anyway.” Then publish.
    - No hedging, no nuance. If I’m getting in a twist about a sentence, take it out.
    - Give up on attempting to be right.
    - Give up on providing full links and citations.
    - Give up on saying anything new. Most people haven’t read my old stuff. Play the hits.
    - Give up on trying to be popular. I try not to filter myself based on what I believe will be popular. 
      Some of my favourite posts get ignored. Some posts get popular and I have no idea why. Besides, 
      terrible posts get buried fast if I’m posting three times a week. So post with abandon.
    - Give up on trying to be interesting. Readers will come to my site for what’s interesting to me, or not, 
      it’s fine, just say what I think about whatever I’m thinking about.
    - But make it work for a general audience.
    - Only write what’s in my head at that exact moment. It’s 10x faster.
    - If it’s taking too long to write, stop.
    - Don’t use a post just to link to something elsewhere. If there’s a point to make, start with that.
    - Titles should be descriptive and have the flavour of the post. And rewrite the lede once the post 
      is done so the whole thing gets to the point faster.
    - It’s ok not to blog if it feels like a chore.
    - Writing is a muscle.

    "If I have an idea for a post, at any time, I make a note of it in my drafts folder – without delay. 
    Or it’ll disappear.

    When there’s time to write, I go through my draft posts (and recent links that I’ve run across, 
    I capture those too) and see if anything catches my eye. If it does: start typing and see what happens."

        In my previous post I had mentioned that my church recently celebrated Ash Wednesday to mark the beginning of Lent.  I've come to consider lent as
        a time to recenter my focus on my own faith and beliefs, to better make sense of some things or try to answer some questions that I have yet to
        really resolve.  So I'm making an effort to continue on with blogging about faith and play, in hopes that somehow I can resolve the mysterious
        connection between these two in my own head.

        I had recently been reading through an essay found in "The Legend of Zelda and Theology" and came across a concept that 
        I felt the need to jot down.  In particular, the essay titled "Portals, Prophecy, and Cuccos: Considerations of Power in a Link to the Past",
        by Jeremy Smith, touches on the idea of "thin places".  When talking about the portals that the player may use to ravel between the light and dark 
        worlds of ALttP, Smith briefly explains the core concept and history of "thin places" in theology. Smith writes, "perhaps real-life portals are 'thin places'
        where the divine world and our tangible world meet or are even seen more clearly... they are places where our light/dark sides are most intimately
        connected".  Citing the Trappist monk Thomas Melton, he writes "God shows [God's] self in everything - in people and in things and in nature and events".
        Smith expands on this further by referencing the writing of Theologian Marcus Borg: "Music, poetry, literature, the visual arts, and dance, can 
        all become thin places in which <b>the boundary between one's self and the world momentarily disappears</b>" (emphasis mine).
    </p>

      Those last few words in Borg's talk of "thin places" is what has led me to writing this blog post, as I can't help but see some similar language in the above
      quotations being reflected in some of my recent academic readings of "play".

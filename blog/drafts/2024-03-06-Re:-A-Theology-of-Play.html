    - Three posts a week, more or less.
    - One idea per post. If I find myself launching into another section, cut and paste the extra 
      into a separate draft post, and tie off the original one with the word “Anyway.” Then publish.
    - No hedging, no nuance. If I’m getting in a twist about a sentence, take it out.
    - Give up on attempting to be right.
    - Give up on providing full links and citations.
    - Give up on saying anything new. Most people haven’t read my old stuff. Play the hits.
    - Give up on trying to be popular. I try not to filter myself based on what I believe will be popular. 
      Some of my favourite posts get ignored. Some posts get popular and I have no idea why. Besides, 
      terrible posts get buried fast if I’m posting three times a week. So post with abandon.
    - Give up on trying to be interesting. Readers will come to my site for what’s interesting to me, or not, 
      it’s fine, just say what I think about whatever I’m thinking about.
    - But make it work for a general audience.
    - Only write what’s in my head at that exact moment. It’s 10x faster.
    - If it’s taking too long to write, stop.
    - Don’t use a post just to link to something elsewhere. If there’s a point to make, start with that.
    - Titles should be descriptive and have the flavour of the post. And rewrite the lede once the post 
      is done so the whole thing gets to the point faster.
    - It’s ok not to blog if it feels like a chore.
    - Writing is a muscle.

    "If I have an idea for a post, at any time, I make a note of it in my drafts folder – without delay. 
    Or it’ll disappear.

    When there’s time to write, I go through my draft posts (and recent links that I’ve run across, 
    I capture those too) and see if anything catches my eye. If it does: start typing and see what happens."

        Earlier this year I read a <a href="https://www.faithforms.games/blog/a-theology-of-play" target="_blank">a blog post</a> by Brock Henderson that I enjoyed so much, I printed it off to keep at my reading corner.  I only just revisted it a few months
        after my first look at it, and felt I had something to contribute to the discussion.

        It might be clear from my previous blog posts that the intersection of faith and play is an area that I've been very interested in, and one that I really feel has been underexplored.  It seems rare that the concept of "play", however you may define the word,
        is spoken of in a positive light in scripture.  Brock identified one of the few places where it is mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah%208%3A3-5&version=NIV" target="_blank">Zechariah 8: 3-5</a> (emphasis mine):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age.        
        <u>The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.</u>”     
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        It's a beautiful and encouraging image being painted.  And Brock's first point regarding this "theology of play" is equally so (emphasis mine):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "...one of the beautiful things about play is that it gives us a glimpse of the life God designed us to have—a time when we were naked and unashamed before God and each other in the garden. 
        It was a time of safety, security, peace, freedom, and joy. We weren't scared or stressed or posturing before God or each other. We weren't hung up on image, status, or possessions. 
        <u>When we engage in play today, we return to that time for however brief.</u>"
      </blockquote>      
      <p>
        This last sentence really struck me, as I felt it tied closely to a very important set of verses from the Gospels:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children." - <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A25&version=NIV"><b>Matthew 11:25</b></a>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
        He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them. And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 
        Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 5 And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me." - <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A1-5&version=NIV"><b>Matthew 18:1-5</b></a>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." - <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A15&version=NIV" target="_blank"><b>Mark 10:15</b></a>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I've heard a few interpretations as to what is being suggested by the above passages, particularly what it means to take "the lowly position of a child."  A common thread among them is <b>trust.</b>  I've heard it said that these verses suggest that we return to the state we found ourselves in
        as children, where we were in complete and total trust of the guidance and protection of our parents and place that same level of trust in God as we grow into adulthood.  I'd like to offer another interpretation, though, that might fit right into Brock's approach toward a Theology of Play...

        Ian Boghost is an academic and game designer, and the author of "Play Anything", a book I particularly enjoyed when reading into the broader concepts of play.  While I am unsure of his own religious beliefs, if any, his writings in his book fell strangely in-line with the importance scripture
        is placing on children and their humble places in the world.  Early on in the book, Boghost shares an anectdote about his daughter, who finding the time and space to play while she hops from floor tile to floor tile, all the while her father is actively pulling her along, trying to 
        make a rendezvous that they're running late for.  He had this revelation, upon realizing what his daughter was doing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Children are forced to live in a world that wasn't designed for them, one that isn't concerned with their desires and welfare.  Children are constantly compromising, constantly adjusting.  That's wisdom, not innocence." - Page 3
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "Children are right to allow the humility of their smallness rule the day." - Page 3
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Much of the book following this point explores what it means to "play", and what it means to have fun.  One big message I took away from his writings, however, is another quote that's

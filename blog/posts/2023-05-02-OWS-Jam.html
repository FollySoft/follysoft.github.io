        <b>05/10/2023 UPDATE: </b>Jonny has compiled an absolutely <a href="https://jwhop.itch.io/ows-zine-1" target="_blank">gorgeous zine</a> showcasing all of the entries into the jam!
      </p>

      <p>This is my inargural blog post on my new website!   I'm unsure how frequently I'll be making posts, but with the unhealthy state of social media platforms lately, I figured it was a good idea
        to try and start this up.  I'm starting off by chatting a little bit about the first <a href="https://itch.io/jam/open-world-shutter-community-jam-1" target="_blank">Open World Shutter Jam</a> 
        - a jam centered on the usage of the <a href="https://jwhop.itch.io/open-world-shutter" target="_blank">Open World Shutter</a> software by Jonny Hopkins.  Below you'll find a dump of shots I managed to capture during the span on the jam, many of which were unsubmitted.  
        I've had so much fun with this lately that I had to try and limit myself on the number of entries I submitted for the jam...
      </p>

      <p>
        I had dabbled with the tool a little bit in the past when it was first released.  I have been following Jonny's work for a while - his work in the alt-ctrl games scene has been particularly inspirational to 
        much of my own work.  When this tool was released, I was knee-deep in Elden Ring, and the games beautifully erie aesthetic, paired the ability to diable the games HUD and use of the in-game telescope,
        it felt like the perfect place to test the waters.  Despite my love of photography as a hobby, I think this may have been the closest I've ever really come to actually playing with any sort of camera-related mode
        or tools in (or with) a game.

        Fez, another favorite game of mine, seemed like another natural fit for long-exposure fun.

        I have a diffuclt time participating in jams these days.  Even lengthier jams can still result in me burning out on game development for weeks at a time until I can find the energy and motivation to open up my
        tools again.  However, seeing Jonny announce a jam for the Open World Shutter, along side of it's recent submission into the <a href="https://2023.amaze-berlin.de/mentions/open-world-shutter/" target="_blank">2023 A MAZE Festival</a> 
        in Berlin, I simply had to participate and take the opportunity to play around with this wonderful tool even more.
      </p>

      <p>
        The jam's theme was "Synthesis", and I had a couple of ideas that tried to break out of the mold of strictly video games and using the camera with other software:
      </p>      

      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure1Avg.png" alt="Twitter Scrolling">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure29Avg.png" alt="Google Earth Spin">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure32Min.png" alt="Street View">

      <p>
        Unfornately, past this point, I ran out of ideas that even loosely fit the jam theme, and just went whole hog into trying out a variety of games and moving imagery:
      </p>

      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure0Max.png" alt="Star Wars Opening Credits">      
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure4Max.png" alt="Star Fox Title">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure5Avg.png" alt="Star Fox Intro">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure6Max.png" alt="Star Fox Taking Hits">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure16Max.png" alt="Team Fortress 2">

      <p>
        I would later discover that one of my favorite games to photograph was Sea of thieves, with it's bright colors and relatively minimal UI (which can also be disabled).
        In particular, downing a mug of grog and looking at things while your vision began to bend produced some of my favorite images:
      </p>
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure15Max.png" alt="Getting Drunk in Sea of Thieves and Star Gazing">      
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure25Avg.png" alt="Sea of Thieves Death Spiral">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure39Min.png" alt="Sea of Thieves Bird Watching">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure44Max.png" alt="Sea of Thieves Drunken Shadows">

      <p>
        From this point I went back to exploring games in my library that had interesting and unique perspectives or object movement, with bonus points for colorful artwork and
        aesthetics:
      </p>
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure54Max.png" alt="Floating Point">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure60Max.png" alt="Ape Out">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure61Max.png" alt="Ape Out">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure64Max.png" alt="Ape Out">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure66Max.png" alt="Fez">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure67Max.png" alt="Fez">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure72Min.png" alt="Pokemon Snap">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure74Max.png" alt="Pokemon Snap">

      <p>
        It took me far too long to realize that No Man's Sky would be a perfect candidate for this tool.  Even better once I discovered that not only could you disable the HUD, but also
        completely turn off any head bobbing or screenshaking:
      </p>
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure110Max.png" alt="No Man's Sky">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure111Max.png" alt="No Man's Sky">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure117Min.png" alt="No Man's Sky">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure124Min.png" alt="No Man's Sky">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure133Max.png" alt="No Man's Sky">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure135Max.png" alt="No Man's Sky">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure137Max.png" alt="No Man's Sky">
      <p>
        As the jam began to wind down though, I found myself returning to the colorful (and occasionally chaotic) serenity of Sea of Thieves, before I capped off my submissions to the jam:
      </p>
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure144Max.png" alt="Sea of Thieves">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure148Min.png" alt="Sea of Thieves">
      <img src="../images/ows-jam/Exposure167Max.png" alt="Sea of Thieves">
      
      <p>
        I had an absolute blast during this jam, and it was the perfect remedy to the burn out I've been feeling as of late.  Jonny, if you're reading this, if you dont make a double-exposure version of this camera then I will.

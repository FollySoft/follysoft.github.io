    - Three posts a week, more or less.
    - One idea per post. If I find myself launching into another section, cut and paste the extra 
      into a separate draft post, and tie off the original one with the word “Anyway.” Then publish.
    - No hedging, no nuance. If I’m getting in a twist about a sentence, take it out.
    - Give up on attempting to be right.
    - Give up on providing full links and citations.
    - Give up on saying anything new. Most people haven’t read my old stuff. Play the hits.
    - Give up on trying to be popular. I try not to filter myself based on what I believe will be popular. 
      Some of my favourite posts get ignored. Some posts get popular and I have no idea why. Besides, 
      terrible posts get buried fast if I’m posting three times a week. So post with abandon.
    - Give up on trying to be interesting. Readers will come to my site for what’s interesting to me, or not, 
      it’s fine, just say what I think about whatever I’m thinking about.
    - But make it work for a general audience.
    - Only write what’s in my head at that exact moment. It’s 10x faster.
    - If it’s taking too long to write, stop.
    - Don’t use a post just to link to something elsewhere. If there’s a point to make, start with that.
    - Titles should be descriptive and have the flavour of the post. And rewrite the lede once the post 
      is done so the whole thing gets to the point faster.
    - It’s ok not to blog if it feels like a chore.
    - Writing is a muscle.

    "If I have an idea for a post, at any time, I make a note of it in my drafts folder – without delay. 
    Or it’ll disappear.

    When there’s time to write, I go through my draft posts (and recent links that I’ve run across, 
    I capture those too) and see if anything catches my eye. If it does: start typing and see what happens."

        Lent is still a little new to me.  Coming into a Presbyterian church after growing up as non-denominational, there are still a few aspects I haven't
        gotten used to yet.  In previous years, I would give up game development during the lenten season, to try and recenter my focus on my beliefs and my 
        other responsibilities as a husband and father.  This year I made that same attempt, but I thought I would try and make the effort to do more Writing
        about where my interests in games and play fit within my religious beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least I can say I made teh attempt, at least.  I ended up not so much giving up game development, but I did greatly pare down my social media usage,
        primarily with Reddit, Twitter, and Bluesky.  I thought that maybe giving up those things would help free up some headspace, and for the most part it did.
        I ended up deleting my bluesky account, Reddit is still blocked on my phone and work computer, and twitter's timeline is completely disabled by adblocker.
        I don't think I'll be changing those things any time soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        My attempt at writing ended up falling a bit flat though.  And I think in general, it's just not where my focus needed to be in this season of life.
        That intersection of play and faith is still one I like to read and learn about, and hopefully I'll be able to share more of what I find in that area 
        of life.  However, I feel barely scratched the surface in the two blog posts I did manage to write before Easter came and went, and the fact of the matter
        is that I simply had more important areas in my life and in my role in my family that needed more immediate care and attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose that, while giving up as much social media as I did was a great thing for me, it was also more important for me to simply be open and attentive
        to the other areas in my life and mind that needed more attention, rather than try to artificially add something myself.  If anyone read those two blog posts
        and perhaps had something spark in their own minds, then great!  I think for me though, it's just not the right time to sit and have those discussions.  hopefully
        that will come someday soon.  In the meantime though, I have still have more work to do that won't make it to my little corner of the internet as a blog post.

      <p>
        And thats ok.  Not everything needs to be shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway.

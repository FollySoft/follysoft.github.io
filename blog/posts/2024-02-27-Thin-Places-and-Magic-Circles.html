    - Three posts a week, more or less.
    - One idea per post. If I find myself launching into another section, cut and paste the extra 
      into a separate draft post, and tie off the original one with the word “Anyway.” Then publish.
    - No hedging, no nuance. If I’m getting in a twist about a sentence, take it out.
    - Give up on attempting to be right.
    - Give up on providing full links and citations.
    - Give up on saying anything new. Most people haven’t read my old stuff. Play the hits.
    - Give up on trying to be popular. I try not to filter myself based on what I believe will be popular. 
      Some of my favourite posts get ignored. Some posts get popular and I have no idea why. Besides, 
      terrible posts get buried fast if I’m posting three times a week. So post with abandon.
    - Give up on trying to be interesting. Readers will come to my site for what’s interesting to me, or not, 
      it’s fine, just say what I think about whatever I’m thinking about.
    - But make it work for a general audience.
    - Only write what’s in my head at that exact moment. It’s 10x faster.
    - If it’s taking too long to write, stop.
    - Don’t use a post just to link to something elsewhere. If there’s a point to make, start with that.
    - Titles should be descriptive and have the flavour of the post. And rewrite the lede once the post 
      is done so the whole thing gets to the point faster.
    - It’s ok not to blog if it feels like a chore.
    - Writing is a muscle.

    "If I have an idea for a post, at any time, I make a note of it in my drafts folder – without delay. 
    Or it’ll disappear.

    When there’s time to write, I go through my draft posts (and recent links that I’ve run across, 
    I capture those too) and see if anything catches my eye. If it does: start typing and see what happens."

        In my previous post I had mentioned that my church recently celebrated Ash Wednesday to mark the beginning of Lent.  I've come to consider lent as
        a time to recenter my focus on my own faith and beliefs, to better make sense of some things or try to answer some questions that I have yet to
        really resolve.  So I'm making an effort to continue on with blogging about faith and play, in hopes that somehow I can resolve the mysterious
        connection between these two in my own head.

      <h3>Thin Places</h3>
      <p>
        I had recently been reading through an essay found in "The Legend of Zelda and Theology" and came across a concept that 
        I felt the need to jot down.  In particular, the essay titled "Portals, Prophecy, and Cuccos: Considerations of Power in a Link to the Past",
        by Jeremy Smith, touches on the idea of "thin places".  When talking about the portals that the player may use to ravel between the light and dark 
        worlds of ALttP, Smith briefly explains the core concept and history of "thin places" in theology. Smith writes, "perhaps real-life portals are 'thin places'
        where the divine world and our tangible world meet or are even seen more clearly... they are places where our light/dark sides are most intimately
        connected".  Citing the Trappist monk Thomas Melton, he writes "God shows [God's] self in everything - in people and in things and in nature and events".
        Smith expands on this further by referencing the writing of Theologian Marcus Borg: "Music, poetry, literature, the visual arts, and dance, can 
        all become thin places in which <b>the boundary between one's self and the world momentarily disappears</b>" (emphasis mine).
    </p>
    <p>
      Those last few words in Borg's talk of "thin places" is what has led me to writing this blog post, as I can't help but see some similar language in the above
      quotations being reflected in some of my recent academic readings of "play".  Miguel Sicart's writings of what play is, as this balance between chaos and order, the 
      "light/dark" sides of ourselves come to mind, as well as Bogost's writings in "Play Anything" centering on a more playful outlook toward the world around us and 
      everything within it.  However, in an effort to make sure I actually finish these damn blog posts, I'm going to focus specifically on one big connection I feel I
      made in reading Smith's essay.

    <h3>Magic Circles</h3>
    <p>
      I'm by no means a scholar of play, however most people with even some remote enthusiasm regarding play or game studies are familiar with the phrase "the magic circle".  
      Most every scholar of play I've read from seems to find some merit to the definition and explanation of the phenomena of "the magic circle" in play and in games
      coined by Eric Zimmerman and Katie Salen (NOT Huizinga, who I had originally believed to be the originator before doing <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/jerked-around-by-the-magic-circle---clearing-the-air-ten-years-later" target="_blank">some reading</a>).  
      Copy-pasting from Wikipedia, we have this quote from Huizinga mentioning magic circles:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        "All play moves and has its being within a play-ground marked off beforehand either materially or ideally, deliberately or as a matter of course. 
        Just as there is no formal difference between play and ritual, so the 'consecrated spot' cannot be formally distinguished from the play-ground. 
        The arena, the card-table, the magic circle, the temple, the stage, the screen, the tennis court, the court of justice, etc, are all in form and 
        function play-grounds, i.e. forbidden spots, isolated, hedged round, hallowed, within which special rules obtain. All are temporary worlds within 
        the ordinary world, dedicated to the performance of an act apart.""
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, it would appear that a magic circle in this context is a pretty hard and fast barrier between these "temporary worlds" and the "ordinary world".
      However, the wikipedia article is shortly followed up with a quote from Zimmerman:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        ""...although Huizinga certainly advocates the idea that games can be understood as separate from everyday life, he never takes the full-blown magic 
        circle point of view that games are ultimately separate from everything else in life or that rules are the sole fundamental unit of games. 
        In fact, Huizinga's thesis is much more ambivalent on these issues and he actually closes his seminal book with a passionate argument against 
        a strict separation between life and games.""
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The permeability of the magic circle is emphasized later in the article by highlighting some areas in virtual games that do commonly extend to the real world,
      such as market economies, politics, and law, yet there is a plethora of other places we could identify outside of the virtual space.  
      We could, for example, extend this into Bernie Dekoven's idea of "playing well", where a well-played game between people is one where the players are championed
      over the game itself.  And what are the players, if not the lives they bring with them into the magic circle?
    </p>
    <p>
      It's hard for me to not make some kind of connection here, between "thin places" and "magic circles", even if it perhaps is a loose one.  Even if these two concepts though,
      of "thin places" and "magic circles", do seem to parallel one another, so what?  What's the significance of making such a connection?  Both of them highlight a particular barrier
      that appears to exist - one that, at first glance, might seem solid and unbreachable, but upon closer inspection, is in fact permeable.  And I think that maybe this unnamed barrier, between
      heaven and earth, between game and world, extends to other aspects of our life. What of the barrier between work and play? Between "me" and "we"? Even life and death?  Could
      the barrier between them all be the very same, and just as permeable?
    </p>
    <p>
      And what of the contents that this barrier separates?  Could we equate the transcendental nature of play to that of heaven, and the grounded nature of work to the world around us?
      Where in our lives, both spiritual and material, do wee see one of these "breaching the barrier" into the other? 
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't have those answers yet, but I do believe it merits some thought.  Perhaps I can circle back around to this in future posts before the end of the lenten season.

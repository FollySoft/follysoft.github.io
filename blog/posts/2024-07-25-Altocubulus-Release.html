    - Three posts a week, more or less.
    - One idea per post. If I find myself launching into another section, cut and paste the extra 
      into a separate draft post, and tie off the original one with the word “Anyway.” Then publish.
    - No hedging, no nuance. If I’m getting in a twist about a sentence, take it out.
    - Give up on attempting to be right.
    - Give up on providing full links and citations.
    - Give up on saying anything new. Most people haven’t read my old stuff. Play the hits.
    - Give up on trying to be popular. I try not to filter myself based on what I believe will be popular. 
      Some of my favourite posts get ignored. Some posts get popular and I have no idea why. Besides, 
      terrible posts get buried fast if I’m posting three times a week. So post with abandon.
    - Give up on trying to be interesting. Readers will come to my site for what’s interesting to me, or not, 
      it’s fine, just say what I think about whatever I’m thinking about.
    - But make it work for a general audience.
    - Only write what’s in my head at that exact moment. It’s 10x faster.
    - If it’s taking too long to write, stop.
    - Don’t use a post just to link to something elsewhere. If there’s a point to make, start with that.
    - Titles should be descriptive and have the flavour of the post. And rewrite the lede once the post 
      is done so the whole thing gets to the point faster.
    - It’s ok not to blog if it feels like a chore.
    - Writing is a muscle.

    "If I have an idea for a post, at any time, I make a note of it in my drafts folder – without delay. 
    Or it’ll disappear.

    When there’s time to write, I go through my draft posts (and recent links that I’ve run across, 
    I capture those too) and see if anything catches my eye. If it does: start typing and see what happens."

        A couple of weeks ago, I released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3240355708" target="_blank">Altocubulus</a>, another mod for A Hat in Time 
        heavily inspired by my time working on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3240355708" taget="_blank">Hatocubulus</a>.  It was made over the course of a few
        weeks in my spare time for the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3267788231" target="_blank">Summer Community Mod Jam</a>, hosted by the Hat in Time discord.

        I spent a little bit of time familiarizing myself with Blender to try and create something similar in structure to the original Stratocubulus mod, and while I didn't get anywhere close,
        the results of my tinkering with python and transform/scale randomization created a space that was still fun to navigate and explore.
      </p>
      <code style="white-space: pre-line; font-size: 12px">
        for i in range(0, 5):
        &nbsp;&nbsp;for j in range(0, 5):
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for k in range(0, 5):
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flip = random.randint(0, 2)
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (flip == 0):
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(i, j, k))

      </code>
      <p>
        The scripting I ended up using in python was rather simplistic, simply creating what would have been, say, a 5x5x10 grid of cubes, with some randomization to alternate whether a cube was actually created
        during a given pass of the nested loops.  Once the cubes were generated, I could select handfuls of the instances and move them around as I pleased, or I could make use of Blenders "Randomize Tranform" tool,
        found under the Object menu.

        Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this mod was discovering just how much impact the scaling of cubes had on gameplay.  The center of the level structure features a tall column
        vertically stretched cobes, while the space surrounding it comprised of smaller cubes that were further spaced apart.  It was fun to discover how the pace of gameplay would be slowed
        when entering the central structure as oppossed to the more quick decision making it would take to navigate the exterior sets of cubes.

        Perhaps it was a result of being a part of the community jam, but the mod ended up being much more positiviely recieved than Hatocubulus.  Despite the original mod being a huge source of
        inspiration to me, I was aware of some of the flaws it had that may have limited accessibility to some players.  Even so, it was very motivational to get such great feedback, and I hope to
        make at least one more map like this one in the near future without the time constraints I had for the jam.

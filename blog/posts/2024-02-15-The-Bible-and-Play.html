    - Three posts a week, more or less.
    - One idea per post. If I find myself launching into another section, cut and paste the extra 
      into a separate draft post, and tie off the original one with the word “Anyway.” Then publish.
    - No hedging, no nuance. If I’m getting in a twist about a sentence, take it out.
    - Give up on attempting to be right.
    - Give up on providing full links and citations.
    - Give up on saying anything new. Most people haven’t read my old stuff. Play the hits.
    - Give up on trying to be popular. I try not to filter myself based on what I believe will be popular. 
      Some of my favourite posts get ignored. Some posts get popular and I have no idea why. Besides, 
      terrible posts get buried fast if I’m posting three times a week. So post with abandon.
    - Give up on trying to be interesting. Readers will come to my site for what’s interesting to me, or not, 
      it’s fine, just say what I think about whatever I’m thinking about.
    - But make it work for a general audience.
    - Only write what’s in my head at that exact moment. It’s 10x faster.
    - If it’s taking too long to write, stop.
    - Don’t use a post just to link to something elsewhere. If there’s a point to make, start with that.
    - Titles should be descriptive and have the flavour of the post. And rewrite the lede once the post 
      is done so the whole thing gets to the point faster.
    - It’s ok not to blog if it feels like a chore.
    - Writing is a muscle.

    "If I have an idea for a post, at any time, I make a note of it in my drafts folder – without delay. 
    Or it’ll disappear.

    When there’s time to write, I go through my draft posts (and recent links that I’ve run across, 
    I capture those too) and see if anything catches my eye. If it does: start typing and see what happens."

      <p>’ve tried blogging about this in the past.  I’ve tried numerous times to wrap my arms around these two huge ideas - the idea of play and my own religious beliefs - but I always get lost in the citations, in the supporting evidence.  
        There are two many dots to try and connect that I will ever be able to fit in one post or essay.  However, I’ve recently come cross <a href="https://www.interconnected.org/home/2020/09/10/streak" target="_blank">these sets of “rules” for blogging</a> 
        by Matt Webb that has rewired how I think I should be approaching blogging.  So I’m trying again.  Don’t expect 3 posts a week, I’ll be lucky to get 1 post a month, but I feel like there are important things 
        in here to say, if not for others then at least for myself, 
        so I’ll try my best to just say them.  Yesterday marked Ash Wednesday for my church, so I figured taking a break for the lenten season from working on hobby projects and instead spending my time on this
        would be a good idea.

        What comes to mind when you hear the word “play”?  Do you imagine someone playing a guitar?  Do you see children playing hide and seek in the park?  
        Do you imagine actors, performing roles in a play on Broadway?
      </p>
      <p>
        Something I always like to do when I’m exploring a particular subject is look up the dictionary definition of a word, as a sort of springboard 
        for the conversation.  Merriam Webster’s dictionary splits the word play up into it’s noun and verb forms, and the definitions of each are 
        extensive, featuring numerous subcategories.  Per this dictionary, the noun form of the word “play” might be considered as a “a particular act 
        or maneuver in a game”, or an act of “amorous flirtation”, or the even broader concept of “recreational activity”, among others.  The verb form 
        can be defined as “to take advantage”, “to behave or conduct oneself in a specified way” (i.e. “play it safe”), or “to pretend to engage in the 
        activities of,” once more, among many others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some scholars of play try their best to encapsulate all of these into one singular definition of the word.  My own favorite, and the one I feel 
        is the most encapsulating, comes from Katie Salen: “Play is free movement within a more rigid structure.”  Other brilliant minds, particularly 
        in the sphere of game design, have attempted to grasp play in a similar manner: Johan Huizinga, Jesse Schell, Ian Bogost, and Catherine Garvey 
        are only a few whom I’ve managed to find such encompassing quotes from.
      </p>        
      <p>
        Yet we encounter a new difficulty when trying to relate this idea of “play” into Christian beliefs and theology, particularly when attempting 
        to find it’s reference in scripture.  Using <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=play&version=NIV" target="_blank">biblegateway.com</a>, 
        we can find several references to the word “play” that appear in the NIV translation 
        of the bible, but they are mostly limited to the playing of instruments (which does, of course, still count for our purposes).  Exploring other 
        translations, we do find the word “play” used in some broader contexts, though used in a more negative tone.  For example, The Message has Moses 
        saying the phrase “don’t play games with us” (Exodus 8:29) when speaking with Pharaoh.  Deuteronomy also has a few references of the phrase 
        “playing favorites” (Deuteronomy 1:16-17, 10:14-18, 16:18-19).
      </p>        
      <p>
        It seems that these broader applications of “play” that we have come to understand today don’t really have much of a place in scripture, as 
        long as we’re searching for the word itself. Searching biblegateway.com for synonyms of the word “play” (“leisure” and “entertainment” for 
        example) also produce limited results.  However, we did already identify that the word “play” is already a difficult word to define, even in our 
        modern age.  Perhaps there are other ways that scripture discusses what we now understand as play and leisure?

        Anyway.
